##p>You can blame the withering of democracy on many things, but there�s only one reason that matters: it�s the lying. It�s all that lying that�s doing it.  Democracy has survived wars, depressions, laissez-faire capitalism, even genocides, but it will not survive mediocrity; it will not survive the global tsunami of cretinous dishonesty upon which selfie-politics are built. Politics hasn�t been about right or wrong, or about doing the right thing, since the deployment of that crinkly android under Ronald Reagan�s toup�e.##/p>
##p>Our political leaders make life and death decisions for people every day; they decide how big the social safety net is, and how many people are allowed to fall through it before they consider changing anything. They calculate the acceptable human collateral. They decide, for instance, how many people�s children are allowed to die of poisoning at the hands of criminals, before they will consider saving their lives.  They decide, on those occasions when life truly is in the balance, who has a better chance to live, and who doesn�t. That�s just reality.  It�s when they make life-and-death decisions, without apparent interest in the people who are actually doing the living and dying, that we are no longer living in a democracy.##/p>
##p>Our leader, Mr. Ford, is, in addition to his public duties, the leader of the �Ford Nation�, a select club of friends and disciples to whom Ford has granted insider-access. He and they rode into Queen�s Park with an agenda, and in their cartoon, every item on it is �what Ontarians want�.  His agenda is not �what Ontarians want�; his agenda is a list of his own inherited ideals and principles, which he seems to place above even the lives of the vulnerable. His �moral� crusade is boring-unto-suicide renaming of the usual suspects; it�s not real, and we know that because a man who professes moral authority, but who refuses to debate morals in the full light of day, is not motivated by morality.  It�s a lie and a sham, and every politician and reporter and party hack knows it.  Morality excludes using other people for one�s own purposes, by definition, by consensus, and by logic; no exceptions will be granted.##/p>
##p>In the last few weeks, Mr. Ford and his Nation have made several decisions which could have life and death consequences for people.  He�s gutted sexuality-education in schools; he removed safety, equality, and consent from the curriculum, leaving every child exposed.  Children will be hurt because of this, but Ford Nations �principles� won out; we will sacrifice a few homo kids for the sake of our Christian agenda.  He�s taken all the money available away from caring for refugees, and is using that money to sue the federal government for passing the laws of the land.  Don�t laugh; it�s quite literally true, and you can look it up. He�s closing safe-injection sites, sacrificing a few junkies for the civic pride vote, as if addicts never had families.  There�s more, but it�s just more of the same, and it�s depressing: stop caring for the vulnerable, start taking care of the prosperous, shut down the complainers.##/p>
##p>All of it is justified with lies.  I could list a thousand of the lies you hear every day, but it wouldn�t take you long to notice the pattern, so let�s just skip past all the amateur-hour poo-flinging and get right to the core: those lies all say, �We care about you�. They always say that you are the only reason they�re doing this, whatever this is.  It�s all for you, because we care.##/p>
##p>The thing is, they don�t care.  And how do I know this? Because if they did, things would be getting better.  Things are not getting better.  You may have noticed that there is an awful lot of things not getting better around here, these days.##/p>
##p>In other words, almost every lie in politics is based upon a claim so easily-refuted that politicians need to behave like clowns to divert attention: if they really all cared about us, why is everything going to hell? �We care about you� is the single least-credible statement a politician can make, no matter how shiny their personal integrity; politicians who remain persons of honour are stained by association.  We know that people who insult our humanitarian beliefs, who ridicule our charity, and who cannot discuss politics without sneering in contempt, do not, can not, have our best interests in mind. You need no evidence beyond a look at the news.  Why even bother digging further?  If they lie about caring for you, do you have any reason at all to trust them?##/p>
##p>The reason politicians get away life-and-death lies is that we don�t call them on them.  Our journalists never call politicians on their lies; reporters have grown fat and lazy on �human interest�, and they never stand up to the liars who make their jobs easy. They don�t ever stand before a politician and say, �We can prove you�re lying. Now tell us the truth.�  They never say that, so politicians never have to tell the truth; they can say, �We need further study,� instead of having to say, �Not enough people are dying of fentanyl stolen from their parents for us to care yet.  When enough of your children die, we�ll study the issue.�##/p>
##p>I would think I was on Mars if I heard a random elected politician go in front of the cameras, to say, �I was wrong.  I believed the wrong thing, and people got hurt.  I�m sorry, and I am suspending myself indefinitely, pending a proper investigation.�  They don�t have to do that; they can let someone�s child die, and pretend it didn�t happen, or proffer their �thoughts and prayers�. They never have to look a fentanyl victim�s mother and father in the eye, and say, �I got your kid killed�; if they knew when they asked us for the job that they�d have to face that music, most of them wouldn�t ever have fun.  They run, because they don�t have to say, �I can live with myself� while looking at the faces of the murdered children�s families.##/p>
##p>One thing everyone knows is that we all make mistakes. No one could ever make such a claim and expect to be credible; no one except party politicians.  They�re never wrong. Party politicians are not allowed to say,  �We were wrong. Our policy was wrong.�  They won�t ever have to say that, because they know they can lie without risk; have you watched a �press conference� lately?  Every actor on the stage says ##em>exactly##/em> what you expect them to say, even the smart ones.  The reporters listen to the same boring lies day in and day out, but they know better. They know they�re being lied to.  They know that the accusations are probably false, that the numbers are probably fixed, and that the pretexts are ridiculous, but the truth-seekers just stand there, trying to look interested, rewarding themselves with endless live-cast selfies, and all that for simply repeating what some guy said. That�s all it is: �what some guy said�.  While it may have a passing resemblance to the truth, it is never credible issuing from the mouth of an actor reading lines.##/p>
##p>I would like to see one of these lazy human-interest reporters stand up to Doug Ford, and say, �Mr. Ford, you may be right about what you�re doing, but if you�re wrong, and people die, what will you say to their families? What will you say in the media, if it turns out you were wrong?  What will you say to the people who warned you against taking this path?�##/p>
##p>I would like to see this�I really need to see this one:  �Mr. Ford, if your thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims, perhaps you could say a few words about the deceased to their fellow citizens. The people need you to share your thoughts, Mr. Premier. And after that, would you please lead us in a prayer for the deceased�s family and their friends, who just happen to be waiting for you outside in the hallway? After that, I have some questions about why this keeps happening.�##/p>
##p>I want Doug Ford to have to look me, a survivor, right in the eye, so I can ask him, �If taking safety and consent out of sexuality-education exposes children to the perverts you say you�re fighting, and more children end up learning what �survivor� means the way I did, will you come back here and face me, Mr. Ford? Can you do that? Will you have the stones in your pocket to stand before me and say you made a mistake? Or will you tell me it�s someone else�s fault? From where I sit, if it happened on your watch, it�s your fault.�  I would like to hear one reporter, any reporter, say, �Mr. Ford, if you need to study the safe-injection site issue, but you know people will die while you�re studying it, shouldn�t you be studying it before you end it, not after?�##/p>
##p>These are questions we should always be asking: Do you have a plan B?  When will the study start? How long will it take? What kind of budget will it have?  What are the criteria of success?  What are the numbers? What are the dates?  Who is in charge?  Who do we get to talk to?  How often will you be updating us? Why did you run when you saw us coming?�  What you actually hear is, �Mr. Ford, another guy said that what you said about the other guy for not agreeing with you was not a nice thing to say.  Can you comment on that?�  To which you receive the only non-answer you should have expected: �First, I did not say that, and that other guy is a liar for saying I did.  Second, I apologize for the possibility that what I don�t admit I said may have inadvertently hurt the feelings of some losers.  Third, I didn�t say that, but if I had, it would be perfectly true because that guy is a liar for saying that I�m a liar. Also, henceforth, vis-�-vis, heretofore and notwithstanding, etc.�.##/p>
##p>We pay these people to lie to us; that�s bad enough.  The thing is, we don�t pay Ford Nation. We didn�t elect Ford Nation.  No one saw Ford Nation on the ballot. We voted for a government, not a set of more-than-questionable moral ideals held by a private club. And yes, it is a private club, with internal loyalties. Don�t tell me that you haven�t noticed yet that every issue�s discussion ends in a Ford Nation selfie, and a gloating �we won� tweet. You must have noticed that the Ford Nation�s victory parties start ##em>before##/em> the public hearings begin? You haven�t seen how often Doug Ford claims to be acting in your name as he destroys the safety-net which keeps the vulnerable alive?##/p>
##p>If you let Doug Ford represent you, watching as he spills the blood of the poor and hurt, then you spill their blood with him. I don�t just challenge Doug Ford and his Quisling Nation to face the families and survivors, I challenge anyone in Ford Nation to look us in the eyes, and tell us in plain language exactly how many of us are expendable. They won�t, because bullies and liars are never there when it�s time to apologize, and because they�re always too busy to admit they�re wrong. Like children; like annoying, stupid bullies with pointy sticks and too much money, but children.##/p>
##p>The cowardice in our reporters is no more than a reflection of the disinterest of the public: when the public gets a boner, the reporters swing into action, fondling their microphones and hairdos while the cameras are running, fondling their microphones and hairdos after they stop. Whatever it is, it isn�t a story; it�s just an event, so reporters don�t have a reason to plan on still being there in the morning. There�s no incentive to investigate anything, and they wouldn�t know how anyway.  Democracy is dying largely because the front-line troops, the reporters, have given up, and we�re all stuck with the results. Political systems that do not punish liars in the public arena have revolving doors for every selfie-driven mediocrity with a talent for pretext and innuendo.  Everyone knows that the other guy is lying, and everyone knows that their own guy is lying; they just prefer one set of lies to another, and no one will ask anyone to back anything up anyway.##/p>
##p>Politicians who lie to the public are not, no matter what the excuse, working for the public.  They�re working for Ford Nation, or Trump Nation, or Dear Leader Nation, and the lives of the rest of us are worth less.  You always know how a politician really thinks by the number of enemies they can name: in Ontario, that means refugees, crazy people, drug addicts, terrorists, street people, single parents, children of atheists, and anyone with the temerity to stand up for them in public.##/p>
##p>And it will go on, until democracy is road-pudding and we all live in a desert, because we�re all afraid of telling grown men and women to stop acting like snotty children, whom we�d send to the bonehead-corner for a week, for lying like that.##/p>
##p>There�s another lie that kills: �it�s not our fault�. It is your fault.  In a democracy, there isn�t supposed to be a �them�; there�s only supposed to be an �us�. If you voted for an �us�, any �us�, which excludes a �them�, then, yeah, you kind of screwed us all.##/p>";
