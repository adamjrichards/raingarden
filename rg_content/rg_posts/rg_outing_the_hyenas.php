##h1>Outing the hyenas who hide amongst us##/h1>
##p>Over the last two days, I�ve outed myself both as a survivor, and as a crazy person. I�ve been trying to start this blogging project of mine for years, and I could never get it off the ground, because I had no starting place for it.  No matter how I tried to introduce myself and my work, it never felt honest. It felt like I was picking an arbitrary spot and starting there, like my life started at 30, and like it was normal. It didn�t feel honest, and I didn�t feel honourable in glossing over the truth. If we all outed ourselves, we could finally do something about the rape scourge, but it took me almost four decades, and there�s no rushing the process.##/p>
##p>Pretending it didn�t happen, and worse, that I�m not �like that�, has been the poison in my breath since the �event� ##em>(edit: I don�t know what to call it now. It never needed a name before, because it was never spoken aloud). ##/em>I couldn�t start my real work in life with a lie.  If you know me, you know that I believe in compassion and honour above all other qualities, and neither of those starts with a lie, ever. The whole point of this blog and this project is compassion and honour, and you need to make things make sense in order to teach those all-important things to people; yes, it is presumptuous of me to award myself grand titles, but compassion and honour really is me, and making sense of things is what I do best.  My words don�t come with guarantees, and every speculation or prognostication comes with a probability of accuracy which you can judge on your own. I can be anywhere from 0% right up to 100% right, and when you or another spots a statement of mine which carries a low truth probability, I need to know about it, like now, because whatever depends on it is likely wrong, too. I can�t be right about anything, until I start where the true story starts, and you can�t face the truth if you can�t face the past.##/p>
##p>I have known for a long time that there was no other way to get the ball rolling. I�ve written, perhaps, 30,000 words over the past six weeks; words is me also, and I am only getting started. You think you got words?  I got words. And every single one of them would have been a lie, because I tried to give you the true answers without asking the real questions, and because I said, �Trust me�, when I wouldn�t show you my credentials. �Me� started at age 0, of course, but my story starts at the moment at which that original me ended.##/p>
##p>Some people, if this reaches them, will do what zealots do: they will accuse me of lying, manipulating people, I suppose by the very sensible means of tearing open every scar, revealing my darkest most shameful secrets to the world, and holding my breath for a week in the certain knowledge that life as I have lived it is over. It will be people who may have seen what I have written, but who didn�t ever read it, who will try hardest to shut me down. I don�t have to lie; I have reality on my side, and you, dear reader, wouldn�t fall for a lie, anyway.  You�d know, you�d feel it�if you can read my posts and imagine me making that up, I don�t ever want to meet you, because you�re the pervert, not me.##/p>
##p>A �pervert� is not always a sexual pervert. Anyone who perverts love or truth meets the definition; �perversion� is not anyone�s word to claim, and people who claim ownership of words must never be trusted. They want to decide for you whom exactly is a �pervert�, and it�s always the other guy.  That in itself is a perversion. It will not work, because I feel no need to defend my work or my self from perverts. If you say my story is a lie, you should be able to tell us all where my story is true, and where it�s not. You won�t. My words stand, and they stand on their own; 35 years of trying to write your story makes the final draft bulletproof. If you already hate me, take your best shot; I will not be victimized all over again by women whose mantra is �we believe survivors�, and I won�t be invalidated by men who don�t have the gonadal fortitude to drop their own pretenses and fabrications, and face the fact that it�s almost always men who pull this shit.##/p>
##p>I must issue this caveat before I continue: there are some parts of my story which I cannot make explicit, and there are details which could mislead judgment without proper context. Names have been changed to protect both the innocent and the guilty; the guilty may have their own innocents to protect. Even the guilty must be given the right and ability to tell the truth; they probably won�t do it, but they must be given the chance. You don�t reach people you condemn, and the difference between a reformer and a zealot is that the zealot always leads with the condemnation; that�s why, after fifty years of feminist �theory�, nothing is fixed yet. When the movement strays from the noble purpose of helping people to the ignoble purpose of fixing people, the  When people tell each other people what they really are, or how they really think, they are not protecting the truth. The truth alone protects the truth, and everything else is a lie which ends in shreds.##/p>
##p>That was all about me. Now, here�s what �me� is about. Here�s my truth:##/p>
##p>The world is full of problems, and I want to solve every one of them. Don�t ask why, because I don�t know; just take advantage of it. I can�t solve them all, so I have to choose my battles sensibly.  I�m a man whose life was nearly destroyed by a rapist; it makes sense that the first problem I want to solve is rape, because I�m tired of the artificial gender wars, I�m tired of being cast as the bad guy all the time, and because the one and only thing feminist theory gets absolutely right is that there will be no end to the fighting until the rape problem is solved. The rape problem is a man-problem##em>;##/em> honesty and vulnerability go both ways, my brothers, and we have to own that shit, even if it stinks so high our eyes burn. The other problem, my feminist friends, is that, in spite of all that theory, we are a not, meaning not, even the tiniest little bit rapist at heart. Have a look at reality. Talk to some of the good men, and you�ll find that men hate rapists with such a fundamental loathing that we don�t want to admit that rape really and truly ##em>is ##/em>a man-problem; we know, that we�re not like that, we do not do evil, and we don�t want to be associated with such filth. We also know that the women who love us believe in us, and no one ever seems to ask them what they think. Go ahead; ask my wife if I�m a rapist. Then ask my wife what I�d do to a rapist. I dare you.  If you have the courage of truth, you can do it, so do it.##/p>
##p>We don�t like the stink of evil any more than women do, and we don�t want it on us. Too bad for us: it�s a man-problem, so suck it up and get back to work.##/p>
##p>But you can�t stop rape as a social scourge if you are not perfectly honest on all fronts. Rapists are rapists and you accuse them; you do not paint the innocent with the crimes of the guilty. You do not fix the problem of the hyenas who disguise themselves as men by accusing all men of being hyenas. That fixes nothing but blame, and blame is just more talk. You fix the man-problem by invoking a man�s protective instinct, by appealing to the nobility in his masculinity, and, hmm, by being female.  No, really, being a girl could tip the balance in your favour, if you don�t hate a guy for adoring you; you knew that, right? You tell men that you need them to do the right thing, for you, and for your daughters and mothers, for compassion and honour, and because you�ll get a kiss from your girl if you do; I promise you, we will belt our kilts, fire up the bagpipes, and march off into the fog while you�re still wondering what we�ve got on under those things. We will flush the predators from cover, pursue them relentlessly, and deal with them in the most certain of terms; all you have to do is to remind us to act as honour requires, and that you will love us for doing so.##/p>
##p>Let�s face it: women as a whole do not know how to do this fighting thing like we do. Feminist theorists have been leading women astray for decades, no matter how good their intentions might once have been. They don�t ask men what they think, so they don�t see the plain truth: women are the conscience of the world, and they know it, and good men must obey their conscience. You, you, the small ones, you set the rules of civility and civilization; women wield ten times the power that feminism permits, because being free of role-compulsion doesn�t mean you surrender the powers your role gives you. Must I spell it out for you? We do just as you tell us, just not the way you tell us to do it. Men will do pretty much anything the women of the world demand, if they will just say they love us, and stop calling us evil.  Men will solve the man-problem, but they will not get on board if they have already been convicted of being the creatures they revile.##/p>
##p>Rapists may be male, but they are not men.  They don�t get that title, because in man-world, you earn it, or you get nothing.  �man� is a set of chromosomes. �Man� is what you become, and nothing comes for free.  You earn �Man� when you graduate from the school of honour and integrity, and when you know that �Man� is a full-time job, and that the job description is love, serve, and protect. Men do not get to wear or divest the job as is convenient, and the test of honour and integrity starts and ends at midnight every day, without interruption or excuse, all your life long. Rapists are not Men, and they must never be permitted to hide behind us. They ruin everything. �Man� as a word has almost been ruined by males who don�t earn the title of �man�, and we want it back.##/p>
##p>Feminists too often equate �man� with �rapist�.  They believe, because it�s convenient and for no honest reason at all, that the presence of hyenas hiding amongst men proves that we�re all hyenas in our hearts, so none of us may be trusted. That�s the �you might be a Jew� argument, and it is vile. �Rape� and �rapist� are not words you get to own, either; haters do women a huge disservice when they twist the meaning of �rape� to make us all guilty.  They are, in the full light of day, condemning the protection offered by men, alongside the abuses committed by fraudulent men who are not worthy of the name. Who will protect the women if not the men who love them?  I�m not a �little bit of a rapist�; I would kill one on sight, without a qualm, even if it cost me my freedom. Does that sound like a rapist talking?##/p>
##p>Yes, there are hyenas amongst us, and they must be outed. Men will deal with them, because men will do what needs doing. Women solve women things, men solve men things, trans solve trans things; we can have common goals, while using tailored methods. That�s what works; it�s called community, and it is gold.##/p>";
