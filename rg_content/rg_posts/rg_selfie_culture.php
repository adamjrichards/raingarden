##p>Most of my articles or posts or whatever turn out to be too long. This one won�t be like that.  It will be way too long.  It may take years.##/p>
##p>Many of us remember unconnected life.  The whole analog/digital thing is not what�s important; it�s the social network that�s the interesting part.  Technology changes all the time, and people both change it and change with it, but this time, we are seeing the first step in human evolution which was not predicated upon a change in DNA (as far as we know�everything is wrong sooner or later) but in a cultural mutation.  Unlike the slow eventual triumph of a valuable genetic mutation, cultural mutations spread like pandemics, emerging in pockets, and expanding to fill all the space within reach. We call it �going viral�, and it�s actually a pretty good name, even if it�s more similar to the spread of the plague than to AIDS. (I apologize for the reference to a still-and-always sensitive issue, but AIDS is the only reference point for anyone younger than forty.)##/p>
##p>Even the best of the prognosticators didn�t really get the internet right. There�s a blatherskite�s myth which alleges that science-fiction has no credibility because none of its authors predicted the internet.  How goofacious; hundreds of authors predicted it, as an undistracted trip to Amazon.weowneverythingnow will demonstrate. None of them, however, got it quite right.  The texting and phoning and GPS stuff was close to bang on, but only one author I�ve read from the pre-net days really got it almost right; an author named Orson Scott Card, in a book called ##em>Ender�s Game##/em>.  It�s a classic, and the Harrison Ford motion-picture mockup was actually quite moving and honest to the story; not great, but satisfying and competent. I don�t remember every aspect of the internet as he described it, but the thing that he got right was social networking.  His version is a little crude, but his extrapolation is magnificent: the most important secondary character in the story used social media to climb the power-ladder right to the top.  That�s all I�ll say; if I�m not quite right, tell me and I�ll fix it.##/p>
##p>Most of the technological advances in the digital realm have involved machine interfaces: machines talking to machines. Lift that, turn it sideways, place it in the press�that kind of thing. Computers from the 1940s to the 1970s were room-sized casings full of vacuum tubes and air conditioning (they ran hot), and all they could do was answer simple questions, but they could answer a lot of those simple questions very quickly, which made them good for answering more complex questions like how do we fire a half-ton of TNT in a brass casing halfway to the stratosphere in order to blow the hell out of a floating target 7 kilometers off the port bow. I don�t know if anyone actually did that specific thing, but I would have if I�d been there, so it�s a legitimate example.##/p>
##p>It wasn�t until the 1970s that digital automation actually reached unmediated into people�s lives. It started with Pong, the ultradaddy of all video games.  It involved two people controlling cursors, the paddles, which moved vertically at the left and right of the screen, bouncing another square cursor back and forth between them. I know�fascinating and fun for the whole family.  Luckily, it was soon followed by Space Invaders, and then by Pac Man and Galaga, the latter of which cost me a condo on Park Avenue, one quarter at a time. Children have no idea what their long-suffering precursors had to put up with.  We didn�t even have remotes, for God�s sake, woe was me.##/p>
##p>The internet started in the late sixties (##em>Edit: I still have to verify that)##/em>, with ARPANET, a widely-distributed group of mainframes across the US, primarily in universities and government buildings, as a backup communications system in the eventuality that the USSR, the 20th Century Russian version of North Korea, which actually did have lots of nuclear warheads. I believe that the �backup communications� were for the purpose of launching ballistic missiles and activating invasion or defensive protocols in case of a successful first strike on Washington, but I never actually asked. We have, to an ironic degree, the threat of nuclear annihilation to thank for the invention of email.  The web came along in 1992, but didn�t really catch on until high-speed home internet came along. Email and AOL were the first wave of �community� building, Myspace came soon after, and Facebook emerged to destroy the competition in 2003. The rest you know.##/p>
##p>Computer hardware took a long time to reach and penetrate the home market.  Social media took off like a rocket; in ten years, it had become the primary or secondary means of social interaction for a population sector bigger than China, and now bigger than India and China together. It changed everything. It ripped the roof off every major social institution of the previous century: politics, academia, religion, entertainment, commerce, governance, and finance.  Nothing escaped.##/p>
##p>It coincided with another change in the culture, the waning of traditional community. Politics was drained of compromise and negotiation in the 1970s, with Reagan and Thatcher, the first completely unsexed power-couple in Hollywood, I mean Washington and London, or maybe the world. Religion was fatally-wounded in the 1980s with the revelations of the sexual predator culture with the churches, and the political predator culture in the mosques. By the 1990s, academia had sold its soul to identity politics, completely abandoning the inclusion politics it had been built on, the popular entertainment world had reached sad and embarrassing levels of self-plagiarism and vacuousity, the commercial world had abandoned ethics entirely, turning lying into an art form as all legal impediments to greed were systematically erased, governance had become a competition of sound bites and incredible accusations, and the world of finance had cheated itself into a corner too deep to lie its way out of.  The one thread that connected the entire horrorshow was the rise of self-awarded entitlement, the pervasive social philosophy that society is there to serve you, not to be served by you.##/p>
##p>Entitlement, the culture of the selfie, wrecks everything. Reagan and Thatcher�s contributions to democracy were the belief that society is a vehicle for the self, not a product of it. It�s a cheater�s philosophy: it pays lip service to equality under the ignorant pretense that everybody is equally entitled, if they can afford it.  That there is no clear law stating that poor people must stay poor is held up as proof of equality of opportunity.  It�s such a boring and transparent lie that it should make even Republicans cringe, but it doesn�t: the right has long since adopted as unassailable dogma the position that not only are they entitled to the benefits of power, they are entitled to power itself.  The conservative political wing has no actual political positions, other than safeguarding the interests of the already-empowered; the optics are that conservatives care about nothing but their own entitlements, or that others are disentitled to confer them upon themselves.##/p>
##p>The left is no better: their senses of entitlement are different, but no less noxious.  They too are obsessed with entitlement at the expense of others; the difference is that they rationalize it differently. The party-line in the holier-than-God left is disentitlement of the rich to give to the poor. It�s as if they believe politics to be a clearing in Sherwood Forest filled with Merry Anything but White Men.  They talk endlessly of sticking it to white males; their entire platform is a plan to erase the influence of the �white male� from our culture, along with their dignity and equality of opportunity.  They literally have nothing else: the Green Party has been the only legitimate voice from the left for decades, and they still can�t win, no matter how sensible they are, because the left has proudly splintered into a thousand little factions each vying for the next selfie in the gallery, and connected only by lip service paid to political ambitions so out of touch with reality that even they don�t take them seriously.##/p>
##p>It�s called selfie-culture. I don�t know if I heard that or made it up, but I�d adopted it before it occurred to me that selfies themselves are not a problems; it�s the sense of entitlement that goes with them. The core of entitlement is the concept that the world owes me, that there are things I get just for being who I am, not because I earn them or build them.  It starts when people begin extending human rights to special cases; victim�s rights, smoker�s rights, gay rights, women�s rights, shopper�s rights, religious rights, immigrant�s rights�did I piss you off just now?  I should have.  I put gay rights, women�s rights, and immigrants rights in the same category as smoker�s rights; I just pulled a trick that all the rights-entitled groups use: lumping thei special rights in with human rights, to make it hard to say no. Say no anyway; �gay rights� and �women�s rights� are really short for �guaranteeing and protecting the rights of all people, now including gays and women�. �Immigrants rights� is not the granting of special treatment, it�s the international law requiring respect for human rights regardless of origin or location.  On the other hand, �smoker�s rights� meant the right to �do whatever I want�, �victim�s rights� means �using the legal system as a vehicle for revenge, not law enforcement�, and �shopper�s rights�, if anyone remembers that noise, meant being able to return stuff when a salesman rips you off, which is not a right, but an implementation of the right to fair dealing (or �ownership of private property� combined with �self-determination� and �protection of personal integrity�), which everybody already has. Rights are not granted, and they are universal, or nothing. You are born and die with inalienable human rights, and that�s all you get.##/p>
##p>Selfie-culture deliberately conflates rights and privileges; if I�m allowed to do something, I have a right to do it; if I have a right to do something, I can do it, even if it conflicts with other�s rights, in which case I have the right not to give a damn. Driving, for instance, is not a right; nobody has an unfettered right to pilot two tons of metal at a speed too high to control, but every kid who gets a speeding ticket acts like it�s her rights the cops are interfering with.  Driving is a privilege granted by law to all who can do so safely. �Drivers� rights�, another noise from the past, was a conscious attempt to force governments to recognize driving and the use of public roads as an inalienable right, a bulletproof entitlement, not a privilege granted or revoked by consensus. What �drivers� rights� really meant was �we�re entitled to do whatever we want, as long as we don�t kill anybody deliberately�.  Everyone knew that�s what it meant, and everyone knew that it had nothing to do with rights; it was just a political tickler to the frat-boy faction of the good ol� boy conservative movement.  Sadly, it actually worked to a degree, and we still have trouble reforming driving laws, because there�s always a self-entitled frat boy popping up to accuse us all of censorship and oppression for enforcing speed limits (in Canada, we don�t.  Enjoy your visit!).  There is no such thing as �specialized rights� under the law; at least here, it�s patently unconstitutional to grant any citizen official superiority over any other, which is what specialized rights do.  There are no smokers� rights, victims� rights, animal rights, drivers� rights, patient�s rights, or anything else other than human rights.  Selfie-culture is all about human rights, as long as I�m the human.##/p>
##p>Selfie-culture began before selfies were invented. There have always been people who made the world about themselves, and for whom other people are just the furniture that talks back.  They�re called narcissists, sociopaths, and psychopaths. They�re not the same by any means, but they share the common foundation of pathological selfishness, and the common effect of using people instead of relating to them; that�s why I call it selfie-culture.  It�s not because people like to take photos with themselves in them; it�s because people like to take everything with themselves in it. They have no sense of community or social responsibility beyond what is good for them; the idea of a �commonwealth� or a �social safety net� is meaningless to them. The only question asked is, �What�s in it for me?�##/p>
##p>Look how selfie-culture has infected politics. When everybody can make the same claim to being an expert, when everyone�s opinion is worth the same, right or wrong, then whoever I am, I�m right and you/they are wrong.  Simple.  If I�m a conservative, liberals are wrong, and I can prove it.  If I�m a liberal, conservatives are wrong and I can prove it. Whatever I am, I�m right, end of story. When everyone�s always right, nobody�s ever listening; that�s just math.  We have a huge political machine made up of parts that hate each other, and never, ever listen to each other, or to you. When selfie-culture infects politics, it�s every man for herself: nobody is trying to do what�s good for everybody, they�re just trying to impose their own set of lies over someone else�s set of lies. Conservatives try to get elected by conservatives for conservatives, and everyone else can just shut up.  Liberals try to get elected by liberals, socialists try to get elected by socialists. Nobody tries to convince anybody of anything, because everybody knows that no one else is listening either. The idea of party-platform democracy was that everyone put forward what they thought was the best idea for everybody.  The idea that former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, for instance, cared about everyone in the country equally is laughable. No one can say it and believe it.##/p>
##p>In the right, selfie-culture is just the same old greed and selfishness with a new coat of excuses.  In the left, selfie-culture is even worse: it�s all there is. There are very few people who call themselves leftists who are in it for leftist reasons.  The point of the left was that the freedom of the individual should be matched by his responsibilities to the community, and that people always take priority over financial interests. Selfie-leftists don�t even know what that means; they have no allegiance to the community at all.  In fact, they seem to hate everyone in it.  They claim to represent the poor and downtrodden, but they�re not there when the soup kitchen needs volunteers.  They claim to represent the vulnerable; they pick and choose the vulnerable according to a rating system, in which �white males� are always at the bottom of the list, no matter what other circumstances may be involved.  They claim to represent the people in a thousand different ways; so how is it that the news about the left is always that they�re being offensive because they�re offended? The visible truth is that the left doesn�t represent people at all, it represents photo opportunities. Every leftist issue is somebody�s personal campaign, and that person is always an expert. If that person is a Latina, then she�s representing Latinas; that�s great, until you realize that she�s not really representing them, she�s representing herself, and she�s not pretending to represent others to us, she�s leading them into battle against us.##/p>
##p>All of the above is explainable, if you don�t care too much about logic and definitions, but we know that the explanations will be more lies: the issues leftists paint into earth-shaking moral crises are so trivial, and the accompanying emotional barrage so overwrought, that no one, even a na�ve �I was a virgin ten minutes ago� gender-studies grad wouldn�t be able to make the usual horse-potato pie with it. Manspreading, mansplaining, slut-walking, slut-shaming�really? �Occupy Wall Street��really?  Cultural appropriation�really?  These are the issues? This is teenage crybaby stuff, ladies and gentlemen; this is for children. This is politics just made for selfies: these are not community issues at all.  These are photo ops for whiner taking advantage of the fact that we�re not allowed to offend minorities, but we don�t have to pay any attention at all to them if they don�t have a single real issue to discuss?##/p>
##p>The left earns my special ire because I relied on the left to represent me in all the dark hours of my life. I couldn�t get a leftist to stand up for me now if I turned over lottery winnings to them.  I�m a large, light-skinned male, and a snappy dresser to boot; leftists won�t give me the time of day until they see my cane.  Then they can�t wait to stand up for me, if there�s a photo op in it.  I�m the enemy, until they find out I�m disabled, or that I�ve been homeless, or that I use a lot of pot to stay sane these days.  Those things all put me comfortably into the �real people� camp; people like me don�t join leftist organizations, we have to be invited, or we�ll end up sitting alone at meetings.  The left no more represents me, or other disabled people, or homeless people, or drug-dependent people, than I represent the billionaires pulling strings on the right.##/p>
##p>That�s what selfie-culture has done to politics: there are no issues, there are only photo ops.  The right poses with the rich and famous, the left poses with the poor and disenfranchised, the right goes home from the billionaires� mansions to play with guns in a dirt-floor shack, and the left goes home to shower and change.##/p>
##p>The connected world didn�t just quietly slide in under the carpet to quietly make life all Jetsons and wonderful.  It arrived in a hurricane of destruction and creation on a macro-scale such that we didn�t even notice for two decades.  It didn�t always improve things; sometimes it just obliterated what was there, and replaced it with a shiny and new, but disappointingly virtual, simulacrum, a placeholder waiting for the new paradigm to show up.  Sometimes, it didn�t even do that.  It just obliterated.##/p>
##p>What it left a placeholder for was called �electoral politics�.  What was obliterated but not replaced was called �democracy�, and it was always a good idea waiting to happen.  The closer we got to true democracy, the happier life was, but it was predicated upon one of the hidden prerequisites of an antagonistic system (party against party): ignorance.##/p>
##p>Democracy worked as well as it did because people relied on other people to represent them.  People who didn�t really know what went on in the closed halls of power had to choose among candidates the single one whom we thought best would represent our interests, and we had to trust him.  That�s why honesty is a legitimate election issue: in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man represents the no-eyed people to the two-eyed people. The blind never know who the real two-eyed people are; they�re blind. They must trust the one-eyed man not to act on behalf of the two-eyed people.  They must trust their one-eyed representative to know enough to work with the two-eyed people, to know what they don�t know.##/p>
##p>In a traditional democracy, voters make their choices with minimal real knowledge of the mechanisms of power.  Emotion and self-interest play equal parts with patriotism and civic responsibility, but the foundation is trust. We�re supposed to be able to trust the one-eyed representative, whether we voted for him or not. We have to trust that the two-eyed people, who are after all chosen by the one-eyed people, will remember to have our best interests at heart, seeing as we pay them and all.  We have to trust that the common interest of the one-eyed and two-eyed people is the common interest of the blind.  It�s all built on trust: we trust that people will do the right thing, because they believe in doing the right thing.  Trust is the foundation, the bricks, the mortar, and all the little screws and nails and bits that go into building a solid democracy.##/p>
##p>When everyone believes more in their own entitlement than in the commonwealth, the system stops working.  When selfie-culture invades politics, there is no trust left to continue building democracy upon, and with no trust or civic pride, votes are meaningless.  Who cares for whom you vote, if you don�t trust any of them? The trouble with voting is you always get a government; it�s never the one you voted for, but you always get a government.##/p>
##p>That still doesn�t illustrate what selfie-culture looks like, or why it�s lethally-corrosive. What exactly is different after the arrival and imposition of selfie-culture?##/p>
##p>Well, for most people, not that much, because politics is boring and it�s who picks up the garbage that really matters (I agree). In the rest, main difference is that in a connected world, you don�t even need someone else�s echo chamber; you can make your own.  You can award yourself expert status just for reading the posting instructions.  Everybody cherry-picks the evidence from tempting websites, reinforcing what they already believe, and then repeats it ad infinitum in their echo chamber of choice, until they become experts. The logic chain: everybody thinks they know everything.  Everybody is an expert.  Everybody knows that not everybody can be an expert.  Most even know that they cannot be experts.  Primary conclusion: no one believes anything, so if they keep on fighting, it�s because they prefer one set of lies to another; it�s my lies or theirs, so I�ll go with whichever one scratches my itch best.  Secondary conclusion: if the politicians know they�re lying, and their people know they�re lying, then the journalisti and opinionistas know they�re lying, so they also are lying, which means that everyone making a living from it is doing it for the money, the status, or the boner they get from being a powerful public dick.  Sorry but true.##/p>
##p>The foundation of democracy is trust; when the trust is not there, all work is halted. Eventually, without maintenance and reform, the foundation crumbles, and no amount of too-late debate can fix it.  That�s where we are now: we have been two entire generations without political trust at any level, and democracy has passed the point of repair. In a world built on trust, you can�t have everybody thinking they know everything, because omniscience means never having to give a damn what anybody else thinks. �No talk� and �no trust�, in politics, are the same thing.##/p>
##p>Democracy is not quite dead, but it�s also no longer practical.  It can�t be made to work unless the adversarial system itself is based on trust that one�s opponent at least has the same ultimate purpose; the commonwealth, the health of the community of individuals.  If you don�t have that, it�s a waste of time: debates don�t change voters� minds anymore, because we all think we know better, whatever it is. So WTF do we do now, hmm?##/p>
##p>Well, since we�ve still got this placeholder here, a promise of the democracy of the future, let�s work with what we know we still have.##/p>
##p>Democracy means government by consensus,  every citizen of adult age having an equal say in the choice of representatives.  It means a separation of the desires of the individual from the necessities of the community: we don�t choose what affects all of us based on the selfish desires of a few.  The common good is the only purpose of government, and no law is made which does not affect all equally.##/p>
##p>Those all sound like wonderful things, but we no longer separate the desire of the individual from the good of all.  Selfie-culture dictates that the self is of paramount and exclusive importance; equality means ignoring everyone else�s need completely, and expecting them to ignore yours.  Our modern and thoroughly-outdated version of left and right is not a choice between individualism and community; it�s a competition over who gets to tell everyone else to be more like she is.  It�s a competition over who gets to be more equal than the others.  Orwell is spinning in his grave like he died on a rotisserie.  If you don�t get that, do your goddamn homework:  ##em>Animal Farm. ##/em>Orwell, George. London, 1945. Penguin or Puffin or Panda or something Books. Public library. Etc.##/p>
##p>How do you run a democracy of the self-interested, without it devolving into a political party game-show I mean reality-show?  Short answer: you don�t run anything.  Stop running stuff.  Stuff doesn�t need to be run.  By ye olde definitions and pure logic you can�t run what no one participates in.##/p>
##p>The future is always a block away down a one-way road. Selfie-culture is not going away; the label is loosely-translated into Ominous as �the ascendant cult of me� and it has the full complement of apologists and evangelists attendant upon every faction or movement. Wait a second�did I say cult?  I meant culture. It would be inappropriate to suggest that many of our community leaders consider themselves sacred icons within closed belief-systems defined by exclusivity and zealous attachment to outdated dogma. What dastardly mind would conceive of such a thing?##/p>
##p>Besides yours, I mean.##/p>";
