##h1>Kings of the World, Lacking Pants or Things Worth Hiding##/h1>

##p>King Trump is the crowning achievement of the American right-wing. After decades of shaking the public down, the ultrawealthy have finally given themselves a sweetheart deal at the public&rsquo;s permanent expense. They have twisted and tortured democratic institutions into quislings of the first order, granting themselves carte blanche; a king&rsquo;s writ, as it were, proclaiming perfect libertarian freedom for those who can afford it already: no taxes, no laws, no civil responsibilities, and a lock on the future not substantially different from that of King Louis XIV over France. King Trump is a tool, a distraction, a bit of sleight of hand, and the American have fallen for it bigtime. If any of you are under the illusion that the Republican billionaire-bandwagon hired Lord Trump as their public figurehead for anything but the most selfish of reasons, you won&rsquo;t remain so for longer than two fiscal years. As long as the US was a benevolent King of the World, I grudgingly supported their kingship-of-the-world. They don&rsquo;t do benevolence anymore; the bully-economics they practice now are the surest sign that they can&rsquo;t keep up with the rest of the world any more. Bullies never have a real plan behind the threats and swagger &mdash; bullies almost never do, or they wouldn&rsquo;t need to get results by threat alone &mdash; and empty threats makes tough guys look like schoolyard chumps in the end. Calling the American bluff is so easy it&rsquo;s embarrassing, and there aren&rsquo;t any real negative consequences for doing so; the results are exactly the same whether you give in to the threats or not, so who cares?##/p>
