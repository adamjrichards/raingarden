##p>Cutting gender or identity politicians out for criticism is dangerous for intellectuals this days, but it's feminists every truly fears.  Jobs, families, careers�nothing is safe from angry feminists anymore.  People like me are genuinely afraid of confronting feminists in public. I�m not, personally, because I can�t be intimidated, and I have nothing to lose; I�m pretty much immune to threats and insults, but most intellectuals in sensitive positions are not.  It�s dangerous to say anything to anyone, about anything to do with women, and we all know that it�s not because we�re all sexists.  The nastiest, most virulent attacks are on men who have been on the side of women�s equality for decades.  Our social system is breaking down into armed camps, and feminists are doing everything they can to accelerate the process, because they think they sense victory.##/p>
##p>They don�t.  They smell civil war.  But when you�ve been driven by the same angry motives for decades, and you�ve been feeding your hate publicly since the invention of the internet, you don�t care about collateral.  Individual humans, usually men, but with increasing frequency any woman who stands up for men, are not humans at all, to the feminist extreme. The worst of them advocate eugenics, the pseudo-scientific culling of the males of the species, until only select genetic stock remains.  Every attribute of masculinity is to be torn from us, to create a world of docile drones, and even our penises are not safe.  This is hate at its most profound, and it�s evil.  It is truly evil.##/p>
##p>Yeah, right, you say.  Another angry man frustrated because his privileges no longer include raping women and children, and because he can�t use women to get rich off of.  That�s it, right?##/p>
##p>Typical.  A knee-jerk reaction blowing off the emotional validity of the entire male half of the species, and it�s ok, because we�re all so used to the insults now that we�ve come to deserve them.  That�s it, right?##/p>
##p>That�s all we get.  That knee-jerk reaction to anything we say or do which does not conform to the agenda.  No, not the agenda! Aieee! It burns!##/p>
##p>You�re all wrong.  None of the above is made up.  Every bit of it is readily available on feminist websites all over the net.  If you go look, you�ll see that I have no reason to lie.  It�s all there, and they wrote it, and they�re proud of it.  The feminist agenda is not some myth men made up; it�s real, and we all know it, but we�re not allowed to say it even when it�s posted on the doors of the church.  Feminists don�t get to hide from it this time, though, because it�s their own writing, on their own websites.  If they really believe what they say, then their agenda is eugenics: they don�t like men, and they believe they have the right to reshape men to suit themselves.  The problem for men, of course, is that when the women who hate them the most get to choose their future DNA profiles for them, they aren�t men.  Everything I like about myself is to be removed.##/p>
##p>They call this theory of eugenics �Toxic Masculinity�, and it is based entirely upon lies.  It is founded on shit that was just made up by some guy, they know it�s shit made up by some guy, they know everybody knows it�s etc, and they enforce verbal compliance with the kind of bullying and threats that ruins families. They demand no-questions-asked belief; not agreement or assent, but belief, and they are zealous in punishing non-believers.  The science they use is false, and the social claims they make are unfalsifiable.  Their respect for human rights is minimal, and where and how men would even fit into the future they plan to provide for us is hazy at best.  Again, don�t pretend this is another angry man making excuses; it�s all there where they put it, and you don�t get the �it�s not real� excuse this time.  Read it for yourself, or stay in your corner and keep quiet.##/p>
##p>If I believe and feel deeply that you hate me, and your reaction is, �You�re a man, you deserve it�, then you�ve just reinforced how I feel, and I feel more hated.  You have artificially heightened the hate-stink in the room, and at that point, when you tell me it�s not your fault, I�ll piss on your shoes.  We aren�t that stupid; that�s just wishful thinking on your part.  When millions of men everywhere feel hated, and your reaction is, �You all deserve it, you�re men�, you just heated up the cold war.  Forgetting for a moment that if women really were afraid of men they�d be a lot more careful about the lying, there has to be a payoff that serves the purposes of people who don�t want men in their lives, over everyone else in the world.  If the feminists keep upping the hate ante, instead of getting humble, then I have to assume that they think there�s going to be some sort of payoff; why else would they keep spewing the hate even when they think they�re winning?  It�s a classic detective move: who profits from the trouble?  Follow the payoff.##/p>
##p>If the feminists succeed in dehumanizing men, what�s going to be left for the rest of the women of the world, who love men?  No one benefits but the few whose personal and intimate lives don�t include men.  Women who don�t want men in their lives get everything on their agenda, and the other 97% of the women of the world can go read Susan Brownmiller until they cheer up.  Because, hey! you didn�t really ever like �the penis�, did you?  That�s what the extremists call men: �the penis�.  They talk about how the penis does this, and the penis does that, as if men have no other volition.  It�s called dehumanization, and it�s what nazis and extremists do, but they�re a bunch of lousy wedges anyway.##/p>
##p>Why would a few women be so quick to sacrifice the happiness of hundreds of millions, unless there was an agenda at work? Agendas mean never having to say �I thought about it�, or �I was wrong about that�.  So after men are defanged, de-gendered, de-sexualized, and their constitutional protections are removed, what do you do for an encore?  What the fuck do you do now?##/p>
##p>Well, Virginia, I�ll tell you.  You do nothing.  You stagnate. You realize that humans are a dichotomous species with profoundly-complex interaction sets, and that men and women roughly complement each other in their baseline thinking.  If you�re a feminist, you now leap to your feet to denounce science which doesn�t work in your favour.  That�s how it is with zealots: there is literally no way to win with them.  You can�t reason with them, because there is not a thing in your head that they don�t already know is wrong.##/p>
##p>For me, the science issue is the best example of why the gender disparities of the world are only exacerbated by feminist tactics.  When you�re convinced that the only way to solve problems is by threat and social violence, you don�t want to hear anything which you can�t align with your philosophy.  Truth is not the issue; convenience is the issue. And when you�ve been peddling the same one-liner philosophy for more than half a century, and you�ve made next to no progress, you either admit it�s wrong, or you turn to strongarm tactics, the way zealots and mercenaries do.  The wedge issue (if you didn�t get the previous wedge joke, then forget it) is sex-aligned differences in brain function and structure.  This is the Twilight Zone part: hold your breath: the women who hate men the most, who revile every aspect of our existence, who would excise the Y chromosome from the DNA pool, unanimously insist without reservation that we are all�tympani crescendo�cymbal crash�exactly the same.  We all have the same brain.  Man brains and girl brains is all exactly not different in any way.  They hate us so much that if men say �we�re not really like you�, they will hate us more.  If we say, �we�re exactly like you�, they will hate us more.  I am so CONFEWSED!##/p>
##p>The suggestion that men and women are born with exactly the same brains has been a bone of contention for the entire history of second-wave feminism and onward.  Academics with sinecures I mean tenure are insulated against critique; they say whatever shit and you don�t, and that�s the way it is. The medieval thinking, which still persists in people and places, was that boys were better than girls, because we say so, and women have to do as they�re told, because God made us first and better, but we liked the soup, thank you very much.  Yes, men can be assholes.  Who knew?##/p>
##p>Let�s step through it: humans have a penis half and a vagina half, or �dicks� and �pussies�, if you prefer.  Now, the dicks� and pussies� brains are all the same, but the dicks are all assholes; therefore, the penis is clearly what makes dicks act like assholes to the pussies.  Are you with me?  It�s the dicks which make assholes, but it�s society which takes assholes and turns them into real dicks.  Are you still there, sir? It�s the ##em>real##/em> dicks who turn society into nothing but a huge bunch of assholes, because the dicks don�t want pussies around while they�re being assholes with the other dicks.  But wait, we�ll double the offer! Our brains are all the same, which means that technically, if pussies had penises, they�d be assholes, too. Who let that in the door?##/p>
