##p>I�m twelve I think. We�re on a family holiday to New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.  We stop in Kingston, Ontario, a beautiful small city midway between Toronto and Montreal. The family wants to go look at stuff, another museum, whatever, but I don�t want to go in, so I sit on a picnic table near the entrance, where there are lots of other people.  I should stay there, but I don�t. I forget to care, and I�m off on a wander, because across the street is the oldest standing building in Upper Canada and I want to look inside.  It�s a dirt floor with whitewashed stone walls, but I think it�s cool. I cross back to the park remembering I should still be way over there, but attention is not my forte, and I end up sitting on a park bench a little too far from the rest of the crowd.  I�m looking out over the water when a scraggly hippyish guy strolls over to sit beside me.  He starts talking about what a nice day etc, and he asks if I�m here by myself, which is weird but I don�t know I�m supposed to be afraid, so I say no, I�m waiting for my family. He is blathering about what a nice scholarly young man I am, scootching over on the bench until he�s beside me.  I�m afraid to move, but not because I�m afraid of him; I think it might be rude. But then he puts his hand on my thigh, and pretends he�s picking a thread or hair off me, and now, I�m still not afraid, but I know he�s not cool. I�m looking around for my people, I see people coming out the front door, but not them yet.  He�s now trying to stroke my inner thighs, and in spite of myself, I get hard.  It�s not fun, but I can�t help it, so maybe it is fun, what do I know, but why is he doing that, why would he want me to go with him? I�m a stupid skinny kid. I start to get up, but he restrains me. He�s pointing to a blue van parked on the street maybe a hundred feet away. It�s rusty, and the windows have improvised curtains, so I figure he lives in there like a typical hippy loser, but now he�s telling me how much fun we can have in his blue van over there, and I seem like a very grown-up boy, wouldn�t I like to see how much fun we can have, it only takes a few minutes? Now I think he�s an idiot, because it�s obvious no one can have fun in a piece of crap Volkswagen like that, and I�m not interested, plus he looks dirty, what�s wrong with this guy?  I say, �No thanks�, because I think he�s an asshole but he did offer me fun so I have to say thanks or no thanks. I start to get up, he restrains me, I start to get up and now I�m mad, because I don�t like being told what to do by some jerk with a blue van, and I guess he sees someone behind me and he steps away from me. I�m ready to clock him in the balls at this point anyway, because this is embarrassing. I mean, what if my family sees me with some stranger grabbing my dick? So I say, �I�m going, my family is right over there� and walk away. My family comes out of the front doors just as I turn around to see the guy take a last look at me and walk very quickly back to his van, get in, and drive away.  I�m still thinking, what�s wrong with that guy? I�m thinking, I hope no one notices my boner, how did that happen, I hope there�s no wet spot on my pants.  I�m thinking, maybe don�t let that happen again, whatever it was.##/p>

##p>I�m 29. I�m living in a room in a flat in a house in Victoria.  I�m just up the street from a large park and playground.  A boy named Michael Dunahee is snatched in broad daylight right out of the park two blocks away, and is never seen again. A nation-wide manhunt begins, one block from my house. It takes maybe ten minutes for three uniforms to get to my door. I don�t have enough pot on me to matter, and I don�t have a thing about cops, so I invite them in. They need statements from anyone who might have been nearby.  I tell them what I can, which is that I saw nothing the morning just before the kidnapping. I open every room and closet for them, so they can cross me and my flatmates off the suspect list.  I help them access my friends� apartments, which disturbs me, but this whole thing is freaking me out more than it should; who knows why? but it will not do to go snakey in front of cops, so I stay cool. The cops thank me for letting them do their jobs, and they leave without mentioning the doobies sitting on the edge of the kitchen sink. Damn�forgot about those. About an hour later, they�re back, but not for me; they�ve had a credible report of a scraggly guy with a blue van parked at the edge of the playground.  My heart is pounding, but I�m not sure why. For some reason, I�m compelled to read all license plates, don�t ask, I don�t know, but I�m thinking that if I had read the license of a memorable vehicle, I might remember the make and model. Yeah, good luck with that, Batman. Then I remember�there was a blue van somewhere, I know I saw one. I�m sure of it. Positive. I can�t fix the memory, so I tell the cops I�ll go to the stationhouse if I remember. The memory will not clear. I start walking past the park frequently, to jog my memory, if I have one. The child is still missing, but the blue van hasn�t been found, and no one matches the description, and maybe it wasn�t a blue van after all, but I can�t drop it. Two other vans are found and cleared, two suspects are cleared�the case goes quiet. I keep thinking about it.  I can�t stop watching for blue vans.  I keep walking past the park; now I�m starting to worry that the young moms will think I�m the pervert, so I only go when I have some other reason to. The blue van is found, it�s not so blue, the alleged kidnapper turns out to be an innocent plumber with a reliable alibi, then�then the details begin to get confusing, my mind accepts that this is never going to be solved. I try to forget about it. I don�t forget about it, but eventually, I forget to watch for blue vans constantly. Besides, the new Dodge Caravans are all blue vans, and I can�t keep up. Now and then, a blue van reminds me of an vaguely-formed problem in the back of my mind, but the Dunahee search is long over, years over, and no one even knows if there ever was a blue van.##/p>

##p>I�m 54. I�m in my home in St. Catharines, three days ago. I�m writing my story. I see a rolling headline on a news show while I�m vaping in the sun room.  �Blue van sought in possible child abduction�.  I feel a click. Time shifts back, then forward, then back, then forward, until I locate the memory; you should learn that trick, very effective in calling up old memories you really want to forget, does not work worth a damn for dental appointments. The lamp comes on, the sound comes up, the movie runs inside my closed eyelids. It�s like one of those old clackety-clack home-movies complete with faded colours, but, yes, the van is blue. I�m not good with colours, but this time I know for sure, the van is definitely blue.  Another click.  I realize suddenly how close I came, that day in that park in Kingston, to being Michael Dunahee.  I suddenly understand why the blue van is scary. I suddenly know why I always have to read license plates.  It has taken me 42 years to realize that I should have run away screaming.  I�m one of the lucky ones.##/p>";
