##h1>An open letter to Doug Ford and other Ontario politicians##/h1>

##p>I�ve been opening up about my survivor-story. It�s been hard, it�s taken a long time, and it�s made life liveable. I consider myself fortunate to have made it past 50. There is not a moment in life I will not be subject to the memories I ran from for 35 years. I had my soul stolen from me at age 16, by a man who likely did to many other boys what he did to me. I have no doubt that there are a hundred million men who would tell the same tale if they could, who could step out into the light and say, �Yes, I was raped. A man invaded my body as if was a girl. He took away my manhood while I was still a child. I�m taking back my manhood,  I�ve kept my honour, and I�m taking back my soul.� The hardest thing a man can do is admit in public that he was raped or molested, that he isn�t a real man, and that he�s been lying his whole life. The greatest moment in a boy�s life is the day he leaves boyhood behind, and can call himself a man; that was taken from us, a we have lived as children in our own minds since the terror began.  For us, the test of manhood comes late, and it is a far harder thing to face at our ages than the simple passing of the baton from man to boy. Coming out of the darkness of your own mind is a test of bravery and faith like no other, but if you want your soul back, your manhood back, your love and strength back, you have to do it.##/p>
##p>Mr. Ford, what you are doing right now has an effect beyond satisfying your voters, your Ford Nation. Your apparent need to impose your values upon the rest of us will get people killed.  Real human beings will die.  Real men, with families and loves and work to do, will die by their own hands, or pass their lives in pointless misery. They will suffer for it, and everyone they know will suffer for it, and the people of Ontario will suffer for it; the only people who will not suffer from it are you and your Ford Nation.  You will have what you want, for no reason we can see, and people will die.##/p>
##p>I was raped, Mr. Ford, and my life ruined, because I didn�t know what to be afraid of.  I, quite literally, didn�t know what to run from. I didn�t know I should be scared.  I didn�t know about consent. The men and women who hurt me took advantage of my naivete and innocence, because no one had taught me that my first instinct should be to run.  I didn�t know for sure if I was even allowed to protect myself.  I didn�t know I didn�t have to ashamed of my masculinity, my body, or my needs, and that they can all be used against me. For decades, for long, long decades, I didn�t know that it was ok to reveal my truth in public, because I didn�t know whether being made a girl or forced to submit like a slave was shameful for me, or for the ones who did this to me.##/p>
##p>All of what ruined my life, Mr. Ford, could have been prevented for me, and for so many of us, if we had learned about sex and sexual violence in school. Lessons on consent, and self-protection, would have saved me.  I would have known that I can run, that I can scream, and that I can tell the world to protect me. I wouldn�t be writing this letter to you.##/p>
##p>Lessons on tolerance and sexual equality would have lessened the shame of being violated, of being made a girl; we would know that being made a girl is ok, because we love girls, we admire them, we like how they are; we would know that it�s the violence that is the issue, not our genders or sexuality. We would know that what was done to us physically was not our fault, that our bodies responded because that is what bodies do, and that it is not shameful to be a boy with an erection, especially if you hate what is being done to you.##/p>
##p>Mr. Ford, you habitually and publicly refuse the advances of the LGBT community, and you don�t seem to want children to learn that it�s ok for a boy to be gay, or bi, or to dislike sex altogether.  That, Mr. Ford, is called �shaming�, and you have done nothing to lessen the public perception that you support it, and participate in it.  If you refuse to repudiate sexism, homophobia, and the excesses of your own Ford Nation, then you are a sexist, a homophobe, and just as self-interested and undisciplined as the citizens of your imaginary land.##/p>
##p>Even in this day and age, a few prudes and religious zealots don�t want boys to know that masturbation is ok, that it�s as normal as eating or talking, and that they are allowed to feel good.  When you make children believe that feeling good is wrong, you commit them to silence; their whole sexual world is their small corner of self-pleasure, and the safety privacy affords; they must know that it�s ok to wait to grow up. It�s ok to enjoy your privacy, and to stay there until you can share your sexuality safely. Keeping masturbation out of sex education is like keeping food out of kitchens; the children will do it anyway, only now they will do it in shame. Their entire sexual beings will be founded in shame and guilt, and their sexual relationships will reflect shame and guilt, instead of confidence and love. Real people are affected by what you do, Mr. Ford, and making children hate themselves is a recipe for all the violence and exploitation that you claim to be saving them from##/p>
##p>You pretend frequently, Mr. Ford, that you just wish �further consultation with the public�, as if there hadn�t been enough time for the citizens of Ford Nation to prepare and participate before. The decision has already been made, in a proper democratic forum, by the representatives of the people; Ford Nation is not the people. You were elected by a minority of Ontario�s voters, Mr. Ford, and condemned your predecessors for governing as a majority without the backing of the people. Now you owe it to us to do the same for yourself. If you knew what �Ontarians want�, Mr. Ford, we would all have voted for you. We, the disadvantaged and segregated, neither voted for you, nor for your party, nor for your policies, and certainly not for Ford Nation. That you confuse the two is a product of your ego, not your conscience.##/p>
##p>We have all noticed, Mr. Ford, that you didn�t leave the new and democratically-supported sex-ed guidelines in place, while you �studied� them. You shot first, and promised, vaguely,  to ask questions later. That�s how we know that you do not do this for us; you say you asked, but we didn�t hear any questions. It seems to be you who is afraid of public consultation, because you killed any debate before you even looked at the subject.  You had long-since promised to kill it, before you had even read it; please don�t compound the lie, if you have any respect for us at all.  Every teacher in the province, all of them, can tell the child who speaks up in class, but who didn�t do the homework.##/p>
##p>The idea, Mr. Ford, that issues like LGBT sexuality, or masturbation, or consent, are appropriately taught at home, by parents, is so far from credible that we don�t understand how you can make it with a straight face. You know that these issues will not be discussed at home. The people who shout the loudest are the people who are least likely to speak fairly of LGBT people; they don�t want sex education in the home, they want sex discrimination in the home. Those who do not approve of the standard curriculum are free to teach their children as they wish, but they are not free to teach other people�s children that they are inferior citizens because they are gay, or because they enjoy masturbation, or just don�t want to be raped like I was.##/p>
##p>Of course, you will deny everything, you will disparage me, you will insult my mental capacities, and you will hide behind the same worn-out excuses and lies that are the mantras of Ford Nation. What you will not do is participate fairly in the public debate you have demanded for years.  You will not stand up before the people of Ontario, to represent them all; you will represent Ford Nation against the rest of us.  You always do, and you always deny it.##/p>
