		##li class='poem line'>so much of  me is poured out, twists down pipelines of ever-increasing pressure##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>drawing moments of my life, and the transitions of electrochemistry in my head##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>there is glory in boyhood, the drivers and demands of the young body##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>drained and drained again, but still and always replenished somehow##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>now, as I swim through the ever-saltier waters of middle-age##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>knowing that the seemingly-infinite scopes of my powers are dwindled##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>i am grateful that for every loss of detail in my world, my mind perceives more - ##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>that for the apparent weakness of my vision, i can see the edges and shapes of a woman##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>in finer and finer grain, and feel no loss##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>and as long as my will is projected on the screen of the sky above me##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>i do not lack for life, still the desire to alter things with the force of my body##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>reigns over my times, even as I pursue the fleeting demons of pleasure##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>and capture, in these hands of light, the entrance to the manifold mysteries - ##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>there to stand guard, a sentinel of meaning, powered by lust and want.##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>these things never change##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>&nbsp;##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>but there is a difference between meaning and explanation##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>i have no explanations at all, but a sack loaded with meaning lies at my feet##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>i cannot tell you why, at my age, i am so motivated by the once-raging hungers of my body##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>i can only tell you that it means i have lost no love for the world and its contents##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>that my love is for rocks, trees, concrete, all manner of living things greater than a virus##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>my love is for qualities indefinable and as invisible as air should be##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>and here, where my footprint sinks minutely into the asphalt beneath my wandering feet##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>i know that the evidence of my passage is indelible, and that with a pen of glass##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>filled with an invisible ink it is written that i have been here, and here, and here##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>that i have struck the ground in the same places that have a million others##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>and that they are mine, all mine, all mine.##/li>
