		##li class='poem line'>We live in a world of something.  The old Cartesian axiom, that i think therefore i am, is irrefutable.  The teenager's philosophy, that we are all but a dream in the mind of a greater creature, means nothing.  There must still be a something to dream us.  Nothing cannot dream something.  If there is something, it is impossible for there to be nothing.##/li>

		##li class='poem line'>&nbsp;##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>None of this, the fabric of what we think about, can happen.  There is a fundamental impossibility at work in the universe(s).  Something cannot come from nothing.  That we are something is established.  There can be no original moment for us.  What we are and do cannot be.##/li>

		##li class='poem line'>How does a universe choose to have something?  Nothing can come from nothing, infinitely.  Nothing is the pre-original state of all things, and something cannot come from nothing. Before a thing exists, it does not exist.  Before existence exists, it does not.  It is impossible that there was always something.  Now is the ending of all things.  How can something have an end and no beginning?##/li>

		##li class='poem line'>&nbsp;##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>We are here.  Something came from something.  We come from something.  Something is necessary, so something is possible.##/li>
