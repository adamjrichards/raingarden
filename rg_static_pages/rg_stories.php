		##p>I don’t write stories very often.  I don’t think in terms of plot ideas; I think of characters and scenarios first, or deep existential underpinnings, or interesting titles.  I just don’t think of telling a story that way; it isn’t a way for me to make the points I want to make.##/p>
		##p>When I do write a story, it often ends up a fable, or a scene from a bad movie.  I’m not a slave to the whole beginning-middle-end thing, nor do feel particularly devoted to the rules of reality when I write — what could possibly be the use of harnessing my powers of wit and observation to redirect the mind’s eye of the audience to what they’re already looking at.  No payoff for me in that scheme.##/p>
