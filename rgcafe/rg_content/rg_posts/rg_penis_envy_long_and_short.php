##p>Penis envy, please don�t shoot me yet, is not a �myth�.  It has no roots in historic beliefs, as myths do.  It�s a total, somewhat arbitrary, calculated misconception, but weaseled-out from real, visible evidence provided by women, which makes it doubly-insulting to feminists. I�m not mocking them; it�s definitely very insulting. It replaces natural phenomena in women with made-up mechanisms, and not ones that even make sense.  It is not, repeat not, a conspiracy theory; it�s just bad science, from a guy who did the best he could in hostile times. He wasn�t evil.  Freud was perfectly correct in thinking that some women really like penises; wanting to steal one from Daddy is just creepy and contrived. Some women do, however, think of �the penis� as their own.  They don�t have to envy it, because it�s theirs; it�s not just a body part, it�s attached to someone they love, who carries it and maintains it for her, and you know that possession is nine tenths of reality, love included. When my wife says �That�s mine�, it�s just a fun, instinctive way to say �You�re mine, you pleasure me�, and that is exactly what both men and women love to hear.  Andrea, �my� wife, is mine; that doesn�t mean I own her. It means she has granted me the right to pleasure her. That�s not sexism. It�s sex. Woohoo!##/p>";
