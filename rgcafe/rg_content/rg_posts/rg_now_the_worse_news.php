##h1>Now, the worse news�##/h1>
##p>We live in interesting times. Maybe the most interesting times ever.  More has changed during my lifetime than during any other mass extinction in all of evolutionary history. We�re in the early stages of replacing ourselves as a species; we�re overcoming the limitations of our minds and bodies with the slow, but inexorable, transition from meat to metal.  Sadly, the cost of developing this evolutionary technology has been the whole planet and all living things who dwell there.  I look forward to sinking into my nutrient solution, the network cable jacked into my foreheads, and letting the quantum computer in the bathroom whip up a perfect 3D simulation of the nature we used to live in, with the trees and the meadows and the birds and whatever.##/p>
##p>I would love to be wrong about this, because it�s a real stuck fart being the only one who knows that the end of the world is nigh.  I don�t actually mind that the end of the world is nigh; it�s just that I can�t tell anyone about it.  The kind of end-being-nigh to which I refer is, in fact, the highly-preferable solution to the problem of human success.  If humans can just stop being human, the planet will recover, but without whales, great apes, and psychotic consumers bent on owning everything except their failures, and maybe we can bring back some of the life we burn behind us.  Only technology can save us at this point, and I don�t have a problem with that.  History happens with or without us, and maybe better with Humans 2.0.##/p>
##p>So why worry about the present?  Who cares about saving the world, when there�s no future in it anyway?  There�s not much point in saving the world now�do you see the trick in that?  You refuse to stop wrecking it until it�s too late to fix it, and then you say, �Well, it�s too late to fix it, so why stop wrecking it?�  You may have a point there, but I�d still run you over with a dung-spreader.  You�re probably right; you�ve probably wrecked the earth, and it probably won�t be humans like us who fix it; that has nothing to do with it.  If there�s even a million-to-one chance that the world can be saved, and that we can evolve gracefully without leaving the planet a burnt-out mausoleum behind us, then it�s worth maintaining our humanity�s highest attributes: the capacities for compassion and love, and for the qualities which make them possible. I wouldn�t enjoy the rest of my life if I spent it being an asshole, so whether the world is fucked or not doesn�t dictate whether I maintain my integrity or not.  I maintain my integrity because I already have integrity, and I value it highly, because I have integrity, so I couldn�t possibly make the decision to stop having integrity.  It�s also way more fun to be compassionate, so stop being a dork about it and go kiss your neighbours.  The end of the world is not an excuse for bad manners.##/p>
##p>That was the worse news.  The good news is that the worse news is actually good news.##/p>
