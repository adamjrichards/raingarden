##h1>Am I allowed to objectify slut-walkers?##/h1>
##p>I love women. I appreciate feminists with decent manners.  If the women�s revolution ever asked me nicely, I�d kick any butt for them they wanted kicked.  If the women�s revolution needs me to dress as Cher to infiltrate Bonehead Central, I�ll do it, if I can keep the shoes.  I�ll do anything they need, but they have to ask me nicely, and there can�t be any human collateral.  Or puppies and cats wearing cute little hats collateral. I love you, and like most men, pleasing women is just ahead of not pissing them off on my masculine traits list.  Sadly, there are people who don�t want anyone happy until their demands are met, and them�well�I�I�##/p>
##p>I don�t like mean people.  I like nice ladies and girl people and whatnot, but I just don�t like selfie-feminism.  You know�faux-feminist hate zombies.  Gender studies on autopilot, wandering the world looking for people they can tear pieces off.  Insulting, demeaning, trivializing, dehumanizing their way from man to man, planting seeds of hate in the women who love them.  They know no bounds, and they respect no borders.  They hate me casually. They dehumanize me ritually.  They threaten me randomly.  And, against all reason, they are convinced that they�re winning, that the world is bending before them at last.  They can smell the napalm in the morning. They�ll fight anyone, anytime. They are so royally screwed, it makes me want to cry.##/p>
##p>The selfie-feminists are losing the war the real feminists had already won.  God dammit, we surrendered, morons.  Half of us have been waiting to surrender since Descartes wasn�t sure.  We lined up by the millions to surrender.  Why are you trying to make us un-surrender?  Are you insane?  We�re MEN.  You all say you�re afraid of us, but lady, I�m surprised you don�t have the good sense to be a little more afraid than you really are.  We�re men.  Some of us are boneheads.  The serious boneheads are very appropriately risking a serious clocking upside the head, even unto the real death, when the good guys hear them threaten you, so why are you undermining us?  Why are you meanest to the ones you need on your side?##/p>
##p>I�ll tell you: you don�t know from men, because you don�t talk to men, just about them.  Girls�that�s gossip.  Stop it.  You will never do anything of value, because you spend your whole life finding petty ways to aggravate the people who actually have the power you only dream of.  Selfie-feminists do the dumbest thing imaginable: pick fights with overwhelming forces.  And then they do it again. Until someone both powerful and sociopathic decides to yank your chain, and the men who love you have all walked away shaking their heads sadly.##/p>
##p>I�m not proud of the above.  I don�t want it to be that way.  I�m not advocating it or condoning it.  I�m just running out of reasons to stand with you, and you�re giving me a lot of reasons to stand against you.  No good can come of selfie-feminist arrogance or viciousness�none none none.  Why won�t you believe me?  You have no reason to doubt me. You know me from Adam.  So what�s the problem?##/p>
##p>I�ll tell you that too: the problem is that the hatebots who lead the selfie-feminists have convinced their minionettes that it�s a war. It�s a war when people fight, and selfie-feminists do nothing but fight, but it�s becoming more and more apparent that the selfie-feminists are not fighting sexism.  They are perpetuating it, because that�s their turf.  Without sexism, gender studies don�t get paid, so there always has to be more.  Of course, there is more, lots more, but it�s not the fun, easy kind, so selfie-feminists ignore it. Instead, they slutwalk. They invent words.  But they do not go to Africa to teach girls to read in a world that will kill them before they let her go to school.  They take jobs as sex-workers, so they can be ritually-objectified in a more conducive professional environment, but they don�t visit the jails or the rehabs where women end up when they can�t walk the streets.  They poster �rape culture� accusations all over the place, but they do nothing for the victims except publicize them, and when you accuse all men of �rape culture�, you make it impossible to spot the real rapists who use the rest of us for cover.  Selfie-feminists constitute the most incompetent, self-destructive social phenomenon since the Sex Pistols.  You�re too young.  Anarchy!##/p>
##p>The problem, he said in his most authoritative font, is that when people hear the unexpected, the odds are good that their first instinct is a defensive position.  When the unexpected turns out to be a major departure from received knowledge, defensive positions turn into threat displays.  I say, �1 + 1 = 3, and I can prove it�, you don�t need to think about it to know that it�s ridiculous.  If I say, �everything you know about XYZ is wrong, and I can prove it�, you likely and sensibly feel threatened, because most such pronouncement are horse potatoes fresh from the oven.  If I say, after all that, �everything you know about yourself is wrong, and I can prove it�, I�ll have a black eye before an attentive ear. I�ll deserve it.##/p>
##p>But if I say, �a lot of what somebody else is telling you is wrong�, your reaction depends on the �what� and the �someone�.  If the �what� is within the bounds of the expected, you might be interested enough to listen.  If the �somebody� is reliable and credible, you might still want to listen.  If the �somebody� is a nobody, and the �what� is too unexpected, you have no reason to trust either the information or the bearer.  If the �what� is �you have to change to suit me� and the �somebody� is somebody you can�t trust, the conversation is over before it starts.##/p>
##p>That�s why it�s so hard to get a conversation about feminism started.  As soon as a feminist hears one of the ##em>Words of Penile Servitude##/em>, he puts on her fury-hat, dons the cloak of outrage, and threatens to get all theatrical on your ass. The words around the WoPS don�t matter; they aren�t part of the system.  When the keywords emerge, the conversation must be stopped.  It�s as if, hrmm hrmm, they believe the words themselves to be bad juju, somehow infecting the words around them, spreading from phrase to phrase like a linguistic bacterium.  It�s called �going bacterial�.  (I stole that joke from Robert Priest, a singer-songwriter-poet from Toronto�find him on YouTube.)##/p>
##p>There aren�t actually any words in selfie-feminism that are not keywords.  Every word has a doctrinal scope and definition; that�s called �newspeak�, and it�s evidence of both evil and idiocy. Using the words themselves to make a subject impossible to discuss is a bit counter-intuitive.  Think of it this way: if you redefine feminism as �goodness and light�, then every time you talk about feminism, it�s going to be �goodness and light�, regardless of what you think.  Eventually, you�re supposed to automatically equate goodness and light with feminism.  I call it the �Orwellian Nightmare� gambit; Orwell�s ##em>1984##/em> is the source of the word �newspeak�, and the clearest portrayal ever of its dangers. Feminism of the self-esteem-enhancement form as we witness it today is built from words, not falsifiable hypotheses and observation, and those words mean only and exactly what the speaker intends for them ##em>at that moment.##/em> When the meaning of the word is entirely dependent upon who speaks it, the word is not real; it�s an artificial construct, a trick, that makes backtalk impossible.  It�s effective on the bonehead element of every species.  It�s embarrassing for everyone else.  Have you ever felt that fluttering and coiling in the belly when you know someone is about to say something profoundly stupid, which will mark them with the sign of the bonehead forever, and you can�t leave, and you can�t spill coffee on their pants?##/p>
##p>There are words in the feminist vocabulary which meant nothing the day before they were spoken aloud, but are the names of crimes the day after.  There are mapped sets of complex social interactions requiring many dead trees to make book products from, each of which is based on a made-up word, with a made-up definition, but which is nothing beyond a pejorative synonyms for words in every day use.  There are keywords in the doctrine which are far older than the things they�re talking about.  It�s cheating, and it�s deeply offensive, but without cheating, there�s nothing there.  If the bullying and the threats are removed from the equation, all that�s left of selfie-feminism is a bunch of words, the meanings of which have been perverted beyond any sense.##/p>
##p>Here�s an example of word perversion at work: how do you square �objectification� with �slutwalks�, and making men the culprit in both?  You don�t get to complain about men objectifying women who proudly walk their pre-objectified slut asses around the block ringing bells and taking selfies for Facebook.  Objectification isn�t real, and it never was.  The evidence for any such thing remains, after more than half a century of making shit up, prejudicially elusive, as is appropriate. �Objectification� is no more than a re-labeling of normal human behaviour; all the grave social ills which theoretically result from objectification are better-explained by other means, and frankly, all the blather about what objectification does is no more than propaganda, if you can�t provide any evidence other than vague assertions of causal relationship between unresearched phenomena.  That�s the case: there is no evidence for a mental mechanism which turns the objects of one�s sexual desire into an inanimate object.  I don�t objectify women.  The idea is visibly stupid: I only know three guys who would rather have sex with an object than a wife, and two I don�t talk to.  Men love women, and turning that into such a monstrous accusation as dehumanizing women for use as slaves is so insanely over the top, I can�t believe ANYONE puts up with it.  �Objectification� is an allegation of rape and slavery, based on shit some asshole made up, and if you don�t believe it, go back to the first use of the word, and look for the evidence.  Anyone can do that, so no one has any excuse for ignorance.  You�ll find nothing, because there�s nothing, and never was.##/p>
##p>That�s the kind of horse potatoes that start wars, not end them.  The angry academics,who are, in fact, the assholes who made shit up, do nothing but find more reasons to be angry.  Most of the reasons are silly�that�s the only word that fits�but some are real and valid.  The real ones are buried under an avalanche of �theory�, none of which requires any evidence other than femaleitude.  It�s an industry with no product but itself, and it�s publicly supported.  We pay people to teach other people to hate us; that�s stupid, and we�re stupid for letting it happen. Gender and women�s studies are insulated from science, logic, civics, history, economics, and general studies in reality.  In no other department is evidence so meaningless and publishing so easy.##/p>
##p>Think of �the Patriarchy Project�, in which feminists are still analysing the evidence that men are bullies, and amplifying it for publicity purposes.  They have little screaming matches in obscure forums over who remains loyal to the Project, and who is a traitor who is undermining all women.  They spend millions on meaningless research, the only purpose of which is to open more avenues of study.  They use their tenured positions to �prove� the most trivial of accusations.  There is no product other than more reason to hate; read it for yourselves � it�s easy to find.  In my world, we have enough reasons to hate, thank you, and since most reasonable men are ON YOUR SIDE, BONEHEAD, what can possibly be gained by exposing the meaningless to people who don�t care?  That�s how it works, kids�you know what they say: follow the tenure.##/p>
##p>Think of �Toxic Masculinity�, the theory which proposes that all masculine traits be condemned and replaced with Prince�s dance moves.  Prince was uber-cool, and I would have let him play anywhere brave enough to have him, but I don�t want to be him. He became an addict in great pain, and he�s permanently dead at this point, which doesn�t really provide the concrete base for the �feminine men are happier� theorizing.  The idea that angry, stupid women get to decide what is acceptable in other people�s core personalities is so far beyond reason and respect for human dignity that real feminists should have all denounced it a long time ago.  They don�t, which is one of the better reasons that selfie-feminism can�t be trusted; if you harbor extremists, you are an extremist, and if people get hurt, you, yes you, are responsible, and you can take whatever shit comes your way with my blessings.##/p>
