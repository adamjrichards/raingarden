##p>When the end of the world is coming, you don�t try to stop it.  If the stock market is doing the �climbing to dizzying heights� thing, then we�re heading for one possible end of the world.  If your world is high finance, you know that when the stocks and futures are doing far too well, and way too many people are making way too much money way too quickly, then the end of the world is the pandemic of bankruptcies which result from the inevitable profit-taking. Capitalism is based on the �buy low, sell high� paradigm, and won�t change, by definition.  Sooner or later, the people who buy stocks low will sell them high.  If they�re too high, no one buys them, and the price falls, and since everyone else is now also selling, the price keeps falling.  Eventually, it knocks out all the buyers who shouldn�t have been in the market in the first place: the lure of profit was greater than the risk of bankruptcy, so little fish who can�t spot a scam or a market trend get eaten first.  Soon, though, all the little fish are either fleeing for their lives, or food; life is back to normal for them, at least.  Not so for the traders wearing the big-boy pants.##/p>
##p>The higher they climb, the further the fall.  The fall isn�t the problem; po� folk love a spate of suicides and bankruptcies amongst the entitled.  The problem is the impact part.  When they paint the pavement after a twenty-storey fall, there�s collateral. Statistics prove that more people are killed by falling executives than by all other meteorological events combined.  Sadly, there are too many too clean up with a power-washer, and too few to bankrupt the higher links in the food chain. It takes a cataclysmic event to pass the misery upwards; it doesn�t happen often, but it is necessary.##/p>
##p>When too many people get rich together, the entire system bloats up like a floating corpse; there�s more money in play than the economy can use. People don�t necessarily want to buy twice as much simply because they have the cash. Half-price horse potatoes are still horse potatoes. There isn�t enough actual stuff, i.e., raw material and value-added production, to provide real backing to the currency.  People begin buying things that don�t exist yet, gambling that they�ll pay off eventually.  Then they begin selling the things they bought, which still don�t exist, to other thing-buyers.  The financial market as we know it is at least four levels deep: people buy stocks backed by things that don�t exist, sell promises of guaranteed profits to each other, sell promises to sell promises of profit in the future, and then collect those promises in little virtual packages, which are then sold with the guarantee that a bank will cover all the losses associated with one part of the chain collapsing.  What they don�t do, however, is guarantee that the bank itself isn�t one of the first links to go.  Either way, no matter who takes the dive first, it�s the bank�s customers who discover that ironclad guarantees are aluminum foil.##/p>
##p>Is that a shot against capitalism, or against banks?  I�m sad to tell you that it isn�t: capitalism is an outgrowth of instinctive human behaviour, the wish to accumulate and possess objects which will increase your survival potential.  We like to own things, because we may need them tomorrow.  It�s obnoxiously obvious, so condemning people for acting naturally is stupid and evil. Banks are a necessary and logical outgrowth of capitalism; hating water doesn�t stop you from drowning, and hating capitalism doesn�t stop you from starving.  File capitalism under �Done Deal� in the filing cabinet of things you�ll never do anything about if you live a thousand years.  Attacking done deals is simply a diversion of resources from places they can be put to good use.  Attacking reality serves the purpose of the entitled, not the disenfranchised. Have you never noticed that protesters dealing with real issues end up in court, while protesters who want to be on TV get on TV, and are never heard of or missed again?##/p>
##p>Recognize this yet?  Does the name �Madoff� mean nothing to you?  The entire capitalist system is a Ponzi scheme.  Judging a force of nature is silly: it is what it is.  It wasn�t always so unfair, however, because people weren�t always willing to buy a rich person�s promise so easily; it was kind of a �cash and carry� economy, because that�s how it is when there�s no computer doing your math for you.  When the treasuries of the world begin to print more money just so a very few people can have more money, then money itself is continually devalued, until it reaches uselessness. Money has no intrinsic value beyond vague promises of future prosperity, so if you just keep printing more cash and adding zeroes to the budget, money becomes irrelevant to the people at the bottom of the food chain; they don�t need cash, they need the stuff cash is supposed to buy them.  You can�t eat promises, or sleep under a promise�s roof.  All that money is just a river flowing past, carrying nothing.  The more money put in play, the greater the number of people shuffling the streets in rags, because the real buying power of the pittance they ever possess is diminished with every budget-slashing saviour who comes along.  The Ponzi scheme usually collapses when there are no more people to suck in at the very bottom, because you�ve made their money useless.  Some economists refer to capitalism as �deprivation-based�; there has to be a stratum of people who can�t afford anything,  for a Ponzi scheme to work.##/p>
##p>That is the pattern of economics from the Renaissance forward.  It�s so predictable that there are always a few smartasses who win big betting that the economy will collapse.  My advice: don�t get your hopes up this time.  The coming crashes are not an adjustment, whatever that bonehead euphemism tells you; it�s a paradigm shift, the same paradigm shift which is sucking the life out of democracy and shredding the social structures we live within.  We are not moving to a depression economy; we�re transitioning rapidly to a digital economy, where prices aren�t set by wily entrepreneurs, but by AIs.  An IBM mainframe analyzes all of human existence three times a day, and reacts to market changes within microseconds.  Money, which is now ALL cryptocurrency, is replaced with sophisticated modeling and exchanges of�dah dah dah�more digital promises.  It has nothing at all to do with actual buyable stuff at that point; it�s just computers gambling with each other, computers deciding where to park cash flow, computers buying low and selling high�you know, all of what computers do when they�re happy. Meat world, from that point onward, is there to support money, not the other way around.##/p>
##p>Sounds dire, doesn�t it?  Relax; it�s the best thing po� folk can hope for.  Think about it: when there�s too much crypto-money (all money, now), there�s more likely to be overproduction.  The world of high-finance may be divorced from actual production, but from the middle-class down, you can only own a promise for so long before you need to back it with something.  The real economy, of food and shoes and public desperation, is a stuff-economy, and always will be; the poor may be dependent upon the rich, but the rich are far more dependent upon the poor, because they alone guarantee the real value of things and stuff.  If they don�t care about money any more, and there�s far too much stuff to sell to them anyway, then this time, it�s their turn to buy low, and lower, and lower.  Poor people who own plasma TVs, buy used Volkswagens, feel much less need to think about money than about the chicken on sale at your local Poverty Mart. The only way to ensure the value of money, in other words, is to keep the number of poor who can�t buy TVs or Volkswagen, ever, as high as possible.  A Ponzi scheme always requires the destitute, in one way or another.  If it�s the ongoing Ponzi scheme of capitalism as a whole, it requires huge numbers of poor people to keep money important to the prosperous.  For them, the sooner the collapse comes, the better.##/p>
##p>Think again.  Capitalism isn�t going to collapse, it�s going to overvalue itself to death.  As the poverty crisis widens, the middle-class shrinks downward, and another bottom rung falls out of the Ponzi scheme; this time, the misery stops there.  In insulating themselves against both risk and reality, the rich and their dollar-store sycophants lock themselves away from the world, protecting what they have. They become another sub-species, hoarding money, buying themselves luxury, certain that their Versailles will outlast the pyramids.##/p>
##p>It won�t.  You know why? Because their own system made their own money useless, and having more and more of useless won�t translate into more useful.  There will be two economies, eventually; one will focus on stuff, and one will focus on money.  Computers can as easily trade stuff as money; the IBM mainframe can be turned against its owners without a shot being fired.  It�s just the math of life: if the rich have all the money, then the poor learn to live without it.  That�s �reality�, and it never stops.  If the poor learn to live apart from the rich, it�s all over for a deprivation-based economy.  What good is owning a trillion dollars if you can�t spend it?##/p>
##p>Let me hammer you over the head with one last thought on the matter: the destitute have no real life, but people just above them own luxuries that would have stunned the ultra-wealthy of the past.  We have computers, phones, clean water, a million kinds of food on the shelves of every market�those are what constitutes real-world prosperity, not credit ratings.  We often would like more shiny things, but we don�t need them for survival.  I�ve never had a penny to my name, and I know destitution first-hand, but I�m alive, I have a home, I eat, I dress well�I�m richer than Louis XIV, the Sun King of France, who ate the same boring food day in and day out, sat on hard wooden chairs, slept on piles of straw, smelled like a hyena, couldn�t go anywhere because it took two months to do a two-hour drive, didn�t have a radio, TV, laptop, or any other source of entertainment readily on tap�luxury my ass.  Kings and queens died from syphilis or hemorrhoidal infections as readily as their subjects did.  Women died in childbirth almost as often as their babies did.  I�ve got to tell you, my poverty is a life of extended luxury compared to life two centuries ago.  I don�t like it, but I�m still here; poverty isn�t the mortal threat it once was, at least in the developed nations.##/p>
##p>Our economy is breaking under the weight of its own success.  The old paradigm was simple � buy low and sell high � and the idea of being the richest man in the world meant something real.  The competitive nature of capitalism has done exactly what it was shaped to do: concentrate all the buying and selling power in a small cabal of the ultra-wealthy, who are then entitled to run the world.  That�s exactly what happened, barring the digital wild card.  The rich have finally taken over the world, which they like to think of as �saving� it, but (alarm bells ringing) they won�t be running the world after all.  The technology will be taking care of everything except martinis, and that, my friends, even among the stupid rich, is called �impotence�.  It means, �powerless to initiate or effect change in a system�, and the only difference between the rich and poor will be the number of pillows and shiny metal objects in their respective possessions.##/p>
##p>Well, really�did you think the economy would escape the digital paradigm, while embracing the digital technology?  Bad bet, bad pony.  The economy is not about money, because money is for buying stuff.  What possible real-world use is there in owning money you can�t spend, other than impressing dumb girls and manipulating other rich losers?  It�s just a number, which you tattoo on your genitals and accidentally post on Facebook.  They can, of course, entertain the possibility of spending all that money, which is useless to them, on other people.  It costs the very rich nothing in terms of real life: they do whatever they want before reluctantly giving some away, they do whatever they want after that.  The ones with brains aren�t collecting numbers just for the sake of more numbers: they do things with their money.  Why? Because they can, and because success is not supposed to cancel out human compassion.  They know from experience that there�s no difference between having ten billion and having eleven billion, so pursuing money for its own sake is�you should have seen this coming�boring.  People, even the rich, like to work, because the endless public masturbation of the super-entitled is so stultifying, it even gets to them.##/p>
##p>And that is why I�m the richest guy in the world.  Money is of no intrinsic meaning to me, let alone intrinsic value.  I don�t want it.  Stuff�well, there�s stuff I like, and I wish I could have it, but if it means putting ten old farts out in the rain for me to live in luxury, it�s worthless.  It can�t make me happy if the friends I haven�t met yet are miserable.  We humans sometimes like to call that compassion, and it�s worth more than money.  It makes people happy.##/p>
##p>Enjoy your gilded prisons, my lords and ladies!  You�re in for life.##/p>";
