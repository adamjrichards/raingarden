speak##/li>		##li class='poem line'>his tone was gentle yet commanding##/li>		##li class='poem line'>his voice was commanding yet hypnotic##/li>		##li class='poem line'>his words were hypnotic yet

away and everywhere.##/li>		##li class='poem line'>&nbsp;##/li>		##li class='poem line'>Sunday passed in the same way##/li>		##li class='poem line'>by nightfall, traffic was being diverted##/li>		##li class='poem line'>by the most peaceful of policemen##/li>		##li class='poem line'>hot dog vendors and chapati makers##/li>		##li class='poem line'>wandered in the crowd, handing out food##/li>		##li class='poem line'>and ice-cold beverages##/li>		##li class='poem line'>and asking nothing in return##/li>		##li class='poem line'>the Minister's deputy had joined them##/li>		##li class='poem line'>and was using his expense account##/li>		##li class='poem line'>to distribute pepsi-cola##/li>		##li class='poem line'>because the government had signed an exclusive contract##/li>		##li class='poem line'>and coke was not allowed on property owned by the people##/li>		##li class='poem line'>when the Minister phoned##/li>		##li class='poem line'>with an emergency request that he desist##/li>		##li class='poem line'>he begged his boss to come downstairs##/li>		##li class='poem line'>it's Sunday, what are you doing in the office anyway##/li>		##li class='poem line'>and soon the Minister had shed his jacket and tie##/li>		##li class='poem line'>and was contemplating buying a pair of jeans##/li>		##li class='poem line'>and a

ate##/li>		##li class='poem line'>and the people went home##/li>		##li class='poem line'>on Monday, there was a run##/li>		##li class='poem line'>on jeans and white t-shirts##/li>		##li class='poem line'>a local tent-rental agency brought him a roof##/li>		##li class='poem line'>and Abdul, now wearing the jeans of a monk##/li>		##li class='poem line'>got his friend Sharif to loan them a fine Persian carpet##/li>		##li class='poem line'>with a picture of a horny gazelle on it##/li>		##li class='poem line'>a doctor examined the ex-Norman##/li>		##li class='poem line'>and told him to get some exercise##/li>		##li class='poem line'>his butt was looking kind of sore##/li>		##li class='poem line'>so the ex-Norman took his monks for a walk##/li>		##li class='poem line'>used

line'>waiting for his words##/li>		##li class='poem line'>the ex-Norman spoke longer and deeper and wider##/li>		##li class='poem line'>than he ever had##/li>		##li class='poem line'>and simultaneous tears grew like diamonds##/li>		##li class='poem line'>on the faces of his people##/li>		##li class='poem line'>still they listened, munching on delivery pizza##/li>		##li class='poem line'>and drinking evian water supplied by a local retailer##/li>		##li class='poem line'>who had decided that he already owned everything##/li>		##li class='poem line'>he would ever need to

class='poem line'>was broadcasting every word he spoke##/li>		##li class='poem line'>along with up-to-the-minute traffic and weather##/li>		##li class='poem line'>their ratings were sky-rocketing##/li>		##li class='poem line'>Oprah was considering a guest appearance##/li>		##li class='poem line'>but whether she would go to the mountain##/li>		##li class='poem line'>or the

must be done##/li>		##li class='poem line'>decisions were made, agendas were plotted##/li>		##li class='poem line'>personal assistants were called upon##/li>		##li class='poem line'>but the phone calls went unanswered##/li>		##li class='poem line'>the captains of industry felt alone and vulnerable##/li>		##li class='poem line'>unloved##/li>		##li class='poem line'>so they got on the phone to Ottawa##/li>		##li class='poem line'>who were sympathetic and monitoring the situation carefully##/li>		##li class='poem line'>but saw no reason to interfere as yet##/li>		##li class='poem

declared Friday##/li>		##li class='poem line'>a day of random Fun##/li>		##li class='poem line'>in clear contravention of the laws of good business##/li>		##li class='poem line'>his face red with a convenient fury##/li>		##li class='poem line'>he decided to call in the army##/li>		##li class='poem line'>whose discipline had made them bored##/li>		##li class='poem line'>and who certainly could

hours##/li>		##li class='poem line'>eventually, their officers rounded them up##/li>		##li class='poem line'>and returned them to their base##/li>		##li class='poem line'>where a sergeant of the regiment##/li>		##li class='poem line'>his bald head shining in the moonlight##/li>		##li class='poem line'>lectured them on the eternal peace of humility.##/li>		##li class='poem
