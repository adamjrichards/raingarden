		##li class='poem title'>##h2##article class='poem'>Not Dawn##/h2>##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>as all the hideous glory of 5AM##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>crushed the will to art from the lodgings of my sight##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>i came across an as-yet untapped kernel -##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>a question that might never have typed##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>its manifest primacy, its utter demand##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>across the grey-white paper of my sleep-shadowed mind##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>&nbsp;##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>and i went to the physicist##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>and i asked her##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>'what is fire? and why is it hot?'##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>a fine woman, civil and sharp of eye##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>and she said to me that which i thought an answer##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>for fire, she said, is the combining of molecules in gaseous form##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>which release their particles of light##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>low in the registers of sensation##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>and each layer of fuel burned is ignited by that above it##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>its molecules breaking under the tug of oxygen##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>and with each collision of electron on electron##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>there is the release of magic, which she called energy##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>a packet of brief life, soon reflected or absorbed by skin or eye##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>and there is light, and there is heat, and there is an answer##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>&nbsp;##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>and i went to the philosopher##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>and i asked him##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>'what is fire? and why is it hot?'##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>a solid man, well-spoken and deep of mind##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>and he said to me that which i thought an answer##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>for fire, he said, is a fundamental element##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>that of the four from which we are composed##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>which powers our thought and investigation##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>and which we perceive, through layers of illusion##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>as the sensation of change, burning and dancing##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>and which we create, as much as are created by it##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>for whom is to say from which well the stuff of life is drawn##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>and there is light, and there is heat, and there is an answer##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>&nbsp;##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>and i went to the doctor##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>and i asked her##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>'what is fire? and why is it hot?'##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>a true woman, honest faithful to her art##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>and she said to me that which i thought an answer##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>for fire, she said, is the destroyer of things##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>in which are inherent the secrets of life##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>that which rends cell from cell, and tears the heads from nerves##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>leaves them gibbering, and us begging for merciful death##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>and yet, is the giver as well as the taker##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>for from it comes food, and warmth##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>and the sustenance of good company##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>and without these things, we are mere apes, longing for dawn##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>and there is light, and there is heat, and there is an answer##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>&nbsp;##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>and i went finally to the poet##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>and i asked him##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>'what is fire? and why is it hot?'##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>a divided man, always of two minds##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>and he said to myself that which i am:##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>for fire is the name we give all force##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>the force that drives the pen across the page##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>that motivates love, and pulls down the wicked##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>with the hot breath of hell##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>and it is hot, because we call it hot, a word##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>which means that which will change us forever:##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>we are fundamental elements, strange fuckings of molecules##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>givers and takers of motion and meaning##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>never-ending collisions of sensation and want##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>and there is light, and there is heat, and there is, sort of, an answer##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>&nbsp;##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>and here, now, long past 5AM##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>the scratching of things left unsaid##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>burns retinas wounded by excess thought##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>and i am reminded##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>of what i knew once##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>there is no what of fire##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>there is only the misery of the phoenix##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>mixed with the odourless, penniless joy of the cremated##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>&nbsp;##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>and still##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>		it remains,##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>not dawn.##/li>
