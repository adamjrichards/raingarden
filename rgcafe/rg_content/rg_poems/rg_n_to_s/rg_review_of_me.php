		##li class='poem line'>&nbsp;##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>he has long fancied himself a collector of thoughts##/li>

		##li class='poem line'>his cells are controlled by the actions##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>of oxygen and organic matter##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>regulated by a mass of unspectacular glop##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>occuping the upper one tenth of his frame##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>&nbsp;##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>this is his magnum opus##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>in it, he examines himself and his world##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>through the lens of his experience##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>coloured, as it were, by the physicality##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>of his existence##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>he imagines himself to exist on several levels##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>simultaneously occupying realms of pure thought##/li>

		##li class='poem line'>his left brain, an organizer of intangibles##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>finds this ridiculous##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>but his right brain, a creator of intangibles##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>seems not to care##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>&nbsp;##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>the contents of the work##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>are in many cases reflexive##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>even recursive##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>he deconstructs not only his world##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>but himself and his product##/li>

		##li class='poem line'>he intends that each meme##/li>

		##li class='poem line'>a closed system of logic##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>wrapped in a jeweled case##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>but really, he is seeking approval##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>his audience is other creatures##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>similar to himself##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>who are likewise capable##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>of interpreting squiggles on paper##/li>

		##li class='poem line'>we cannot know how well he succeeds in his quest##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>it may be that he has already used up##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>all his best thoughts##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>because there are some excellent deconstructions here##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>and some trivial doggerel of a political nature##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>some of it is redeemed by its humour##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>but those who do not share his philosophies##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>may find his work##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>self-indulgent and solipsistic##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>imagining as he does that he is the centre of the world##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>and that centre should be spelled centre not center##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>&nbsp;##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>in some cases, he has achieved what he sets out to do##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>the problem is, that without a clear guide to his intentions##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>much of his work descends into obscurity##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>wrapped too tightly in its compression##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>to shed light on the world that surrounds him##/li>
		##li class='poem line'>apparently, he wishes the reader to believe##/li>
