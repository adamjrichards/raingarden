	##h3>All of the following is true:##/h3>

	##p>My favourite colour is still blue, and not because society told me I had to like it.##/p>

	##p>I literally have given a guy the shirt off my back.  He fell asleep in the sun.  He needed it more than I did.##/p>

	##p>I have had 12 to 15 bipolar mood cycles per year since I knew what a year was. I’m about to turn 55.##/p>

	##p>Around late November, 1997 (I think), I was walking home from afternoon class when I found a brain-injury patient lying in a overflowing gutter by a highway, just as it was getting dark.  I recognized him from the meds group at the psych clinic. He was bigger than I was back then.  I carried, dragged, and held him up so he could walk for over an hour through a heavy winter-rain, wearing nothing but a t-shirt and a jean jacket. I used every scrap of information I could dredge up to figure out where the care-home was, and I found it just when I couldn’t hold him anymore.  I got him to the front path, and rang the doorbell.  An orderly and a nurse came out and took over from me, without a word to me. They helped him up the stairs, while I stood there just watching. The nurse turned and looked at me for perhaps one second, said, “Thanks for bringing him back,” and closed the door behind her. The porchlight went off, leaving me standing there in the dark. I walked home in the continuing downpour, where I accidentally let the cat out.##/p>

	##p>My greatest ambition is to die knowing I was a good husband.##/p>

	##p>I’ve endured, without hyperbole, a lifetime of pain and humiliation that stuns people. For a lot of people, it’s really hard to understand; how can one person have so much bad luck? It’s hard to get their minds around it, because these days, I look good and I feel good; I don’t look like desperation and despair look. I get that; it’s not a problem, it’s nice that you noticed, actually. One can sympathize without knowing what it’s like from inside; that’s normal and proper. You don’t have to feel someone’s pain to know that it hurts them. For me, the past hurt, but it’s not an issue now, it’s just a fact. Really, I don’t want your sympathy; I’m good, thank you, I appreciate the thought, but I’m one of the lucky ones. Just believe me in your guts; there are people who have never known a lasting moment of happiness, who have never had a chance to love life. They live two doors down from you. No, I don’t blame you for not understanding. I blame you for pretending you do.##/p>

	##p>I am large.  I didn’t know it for most of my life.##/p>

	##p>I genuinely do not give a damn about money.  Totally uninterested, don’t particularly want it, would give it away if Andrea wasn’t watching out for me.  I haven’t taken a vow of poverty, and I’m not making whine out of sour grapes; I just really have no attraction to it. Sometimes I wish I had stuff that I don’t have, but owning things is not my gig.  I’m not criticizing anyone, mind you…I know I’m the oddity, and it’s not because I’m holy.  It’s not like money is someone’s fault — from what I see, it’s as natural as clothing or cooked food.  I would just rather have the clothing and cooked food.##/p>

	##p>Dying doesn’t scare me.  I won’t live through it, so who cares?  Living scares me. Also those crazy multi-crawler things in the basement, with the forty-seven legs that keep wiggling after you crush the little bastards.##/p>

	##p>My wife is what I love most about me.##/p>

	##p>If you bully people in front of me, I will seriously consider clocking you.  If you get physical about it, I will probably clock you.  You’ll probably hurt me, but I only have to hit most of you once, and for the rest, well…we’re all equal when I have a hammer in my hand.##/p>

	##p>I’ve been teaching myself to tell people that I love them, even if they think I’m an idiot.##/p>

	##p>I have never held a non-academic job for more than a year. I’ve realized, finally, that I’m not supposed to be holding jobs.  I have too much work to do.##/p>

	##p>I live in a small city I love.  It was a GM-factory town when I was a child here, but the plants were shuttered or automated, so we sell high-class booze here now, along with the car parts.  My city is St. Catharines, and my region is Niagara, and my province is Ontario, and my country is normal compared to everyone else’s, too bad for you, deal with it, I don’t care.  This is the greatest nation on earth, you poor, blighted, unCanadian bastards, but we’re normally just way too cool to make you feel any worse than you already have to. Sorry. Just kidding. Not really. Maybe.##/p>

	##p>I love people when I don’t not love them.  Love is the default setting.  You have to work to dis-earn my love.##/p>

	##p>I’m a breast man. I’m proud to say that since I lost the weight, I can just enjoy them on other people.  Having my own was not in the original contract, the way I remember it.##/p>

	##p>I don’t feel fear correctly.  My brain translates it into other things. You can’t intimidate me; don’t take it as a challenge, because you just can’t. I won’t ever run away, and I will retain indefinitely the right to hunt you down and eat your babies. It isn’t rational, so let’s not test that theory and say we didn’t, okay?##/p>

	##p>I don’t care if you’re smarter than me or not. Everyone has a thing. My thing is being the smart guy, but that’s all it is: my thing. My friends aren’t offended by my smartitude, because they know I don’t think I’m better than anyone else. Believe it or not, regular people don’t care if you’re smarter than them; they care whether you’re fun at parties, whether you’ll show up at the barn-raising, and whether they can leave the silver out while you’re around.  That’s what matters to normal-world citizens. Other smart people, when they bump foreheads with me, all too frequently seem to take me as a challenge.  They want to knock me off my pedestal, show me who’s the  smartest guy in the room, take me down a peg…good luck with that, Batman. People, the ones who don’t think of themselves as smart, can see perfectly well on their own that I’m not on a pedestal, that I hate pedestals, that I wouldn’t be caught dead on a pedestal if you paid for it yourself, and that if you leave a pedestal in front of the house I’ll have it towed at your expense.##/p>
	##p>I was unable to use the word “hate” for many years.  It is the most vile swear-word in the English-language.##/p>
